# Recover-Eroded-Text-Plates-at-Historical-Sites-with-Bert
## Academic Research (Dr. Yijun Zhao)                                                                                                                               
#### Problem: 
    Use BERT-large-uncased model to recover eroded words on the historical plates
    
#### Data:
    text data generated by OCR from the eroded historical plates
    
#### Outcome:
    Final accuracy rate: 73%
    
#### Project Details:
1. Compared BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and other BERT-related NLP models on the masked language task
2. Chosen BERT-large-uncased model to predict 2,000 eroded words on the historical sites with accuracy rate as 40.2%
3. Combined the clues about the eroded words such as the identified letters with BERT to improve accuracy rate to 73%

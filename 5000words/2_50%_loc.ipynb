      "[CLS] Think ! [MASK] 's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks ... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to . An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device . This frees the SCSI bus for [MASK] devices . This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices . While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers . When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data . On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it . This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time . [SEP]\n",

Me too , though unfortunately the `` Official Line '' is the one that you have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence .

It surprises me that none of the rider groups here , either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time in order to pass , that the front brake must be applied before the rear , that you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time ( instead of just when it is justified ) - there 's probably a few more too , which I ca n't think of for the moment .

Have there been : any significant problems ? : : -- : Dick Grady Salem , NH , USA grady @ world.std.com : So many newsgroups , so little time ! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last [MASK] . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is `` a characteristic of the transmission . '' Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to only 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD ( 8600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for `` engine longevity '' reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a bad individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me [MASK] to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . [SEP]\n",

      "Paragraph: \n",
      "[CLS] [ . . . ] I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of `` right '' and `` wrong '' ( or `` correct/incorrect '' or `` true/false '' ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is [MASK] ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is `` right '' ( correct , true , veridical ) or `` wrong '' ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply ca n't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the `` rightness '' of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one can not feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the `` correctness '' of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is [MASK] ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] A word of warning , though : Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name . When I obtained my second motorcycle , I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike . I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle . For about the same money ( $ 20 ) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock ( advantages : lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both , Kryptonite name ) or a cheesy no-name U-lock ( advantages : real steel ) . I chose the Kryptonite cable . After [MASK] than a week , I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock . First , the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite , is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee , and does n't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance . It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it . Secondly , the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke . I do n't know if mine was a particularly poor example , but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage , and sometimes it would seem to engage , only to fall open when I went to unlock it . Thirdly , the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark . I did n't try it ( obviously ) , but I have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an `` insert screwdriver and TORQUE '' attack . Fourthly , the cable was [MASK] , in my opinion , of sufficient thickness to deter theft ( for my piece of crap bicycle , that is ) . All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time . If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers .

      "[CLS] completed Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon ? If you are trying to write a game , you should n't be using SndPlay . Instead , make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it . It works great . You can add CallBacks to the channel also to [MASK] you know when the channel is getting empty . Before it gets empty . 7.1 , Callbacks are very reliable , I found them 100 % reliable , even under System 4.1 . I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation . You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels , of course you did n't get called . In general , if you have problems with sounds [MASK] when you play one per channel and then close the channel ( with the related slowdown ) , but then when you play more than one you do n't work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel , possibly the same one multiple times . This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays . Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them . You need to resedit the sound and remove that command , then when you create your channel , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth . Then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want . You 'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd 's , since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks . Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it , and the sound manager does n't work for games , remember , Spectre uses it . And it works great . If Spectre can spare the CPU time , you can too . One little disclaimer : There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi ca n't be made to work right . I 'm not sure either way , but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100 % correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Well , there *is* a difference . I do n't happen to have my SAE manual handy , but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature . The SAE numbers are based on a ` typical ' curve that oils used to all have , running from ( say ) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C , down to ( say ) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C , for a typical 40-weight oil . Oils that are designed for operation in ` normal ' temperatures just have a weight specification . Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a ` W ' tacked on the end , so in winter in a cold place , you 'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer , to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year . Modern multi-viscosity [MASK] change viscosity much less with temperature . As a result , their viscosity graphs cross over several curves . A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures , a ` normal ' operating temperature and a ` cold ' one ( though I ca n't remember the numbers ... ) . In any event , the weights do indicate a significant difference . Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated ( by the thermostat and radiator or air fins ) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something . Any weight of oil is better than no oil , or than very old , carbonized oil . Thin oil wo n't ( in general ) lubricate as well at temperature , thicker oil will ( like a 20W50 ) will lubricate better at temperature , but not as well during startup , when most engine wear occurs .

'' O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research `` is a real question for me . '' O'Connor said `` everything is fair game , '' including `` dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry , chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country , working closely with the Russian space station Mir , and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet . '' O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far , and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost . The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF [MASK] a high cost option ( I believe Kathy Sawyer , the Post writer , got confused here . I listened in on part of O'Connor 's briefing to the press on Monday , and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three [MASK] , sorted by cost [ low , medium , and high ] . In another part of the briefing , he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ SSF derivative @ LaRC , modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC , and Single Launch Core [ `` wingless Orbiter '' ] @ JSC . Later , in response to a reporters question , I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a `` moderate '' cost option , in between low & high cost options . Not the `` high cost '' option as Sawyer wrote ) . The article goes on to describe the other two options as `` one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit , similar to the Russian Mir . The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch , like Skylab . That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage , for example , in its basic structure . '' [SEP]\n",

'' A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said `` the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , '' the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported . But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment . `` This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , '' the statement reads . The five men , together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence , were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar [MASK] of Azerbaijan , between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan , after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops . However , the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh . Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union , are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war . The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the Russian authorities . It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a [MASK] with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey . Itar-tass said that the soldiers ' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency . [SEP]\n",

I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price . The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard ( that 's the brand of the motherboard ) with OPTI chip set , the other is Micron ( formerly Edge Technology ) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard . I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never [MASK] of Cache ! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my [MASK] is that they are known for building good , solid machines and they have good tech support ( 24 hr , 7 days/wk ) , and a better warrantee ( 2 years ) .

Is the Micron machine the clear choice ? Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company ? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards ?

My daughter 's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics . This week they sent something *very* interesting . It was an article written by the leader of a national ( US ) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem . While there , he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem . The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible . What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only [MASK] permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building . The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building . Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque , making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war . Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices , as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days . Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start , I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen . Brothers and [MASK] , the time is at hand .

      "[CLS] Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems : 1 ) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM , which is what I have . This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01 . A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM . 2 ) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations : a ) Under NDW , when an entry in a list is highlighted ( such as in an Open [MASK] ) and then is deselected , a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be . b ) With Word for Windows , when you use shading in a table , the display shows the INVERSE of the shading ; for example , if you shade the cell as 10 % , the display is 90 % ( the printout is OK ) . 3 ) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment . The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon ( or use the Debugger option in the Run command ) , and the debugger application goes to VGA character mode ( as it is designed to do ) . The screen goes haywire , and is largely unreadable . The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled . Through trial and [MASK] , I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [ Alt-Spacebar ] followed by the letter `` R '' . This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen , and it does this satisfactorily . I wish I did n't have to do this . The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers . The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows . There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode . The problem is not my monitor . The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one . I still like this video card , and am hoping its problems will be remedied ( they do offer a 5 year warranty ) . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive . I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision . More than that would seem to be wasted . Perhaps the [MASK] buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding . Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit ( 8 bits per component ) frame buffers . This set up , called [MASK] buffering , allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer ( containing the previous frame ) is displayed . This makes for smoother animation . Well hey if you want to brag about numbers , the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel . Full double buffering ( Two 24 bit buffers ) , a 24 bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage . Mind you the card costs more than your workstation . -- Chris Lilley -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Technical Author , ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit , Manchester Computing Centre , Oxford Road , Manchester , UK .

      "[CLS] ( stuff deleted ) My 66 DX2 [MASK] about a week old and is custom built by me and for me . I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler . This one has precision ball bearings in the motor . It has a pretty [MASK] heat sink ; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip . It attaches with peel off adhesive . This is a full size AT case , so the fan has gravity in its favor . I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go . All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable . There are other `` board '' type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them . They are powered by the slot . I do n't know how effective they are ; maybe someone else could comment . The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP & C unit . PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day delivery . The Y cord is 7.00 if you do n't have a spare lead off the power supply . PCP & C make the best power supplies available IMHO . [SEP]\n",

When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of [MASK] ( an essentially FA ) in reducing inflammation . The evidence was mixed . [ Many of these studies are discussed in `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease , '' MacDermott , Stenson . 1992 . ] But if I recall correctly , there were some methodological bones to [MASK] picked with the studies ( both the ones w/pos . and w/neg . results ) .

What 's the view of the gastro . community on EPA these days ? EPA supplements , along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly ( though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10 % calories ) .

      "[CLS] Superficially a good answer , but it is n't that simple . An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries , as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner . For instance , some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US , to make tender juicy steaks and burgers . They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out . Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea ; instead , we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they 've got . Perhaps it 's more accurate to say that there 's a Western ethic against Western infanticide . All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World , we could n't give a shit . And that goes for the supposed `` Pro-Life '' movement , too . They could save far [MASK] lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion . Hell , if they 're only interested in fetuses , they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China .

      "[CLS] All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura . Otherwise , they are following a law put into effect by the Church , and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so . Andy Byler [ You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law . The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law , and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians . This argument is based on Paul 's letters , Acts , and in a more general sense , Jesus ' teachings . Further , most people argue that [MASK] shows worship occuring on Sunday , and Paul endorsing it . I understand that these points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more time . The point I 'm making here is not that these arguments are right , but that the backing they claim is Scripture . Accepting the principle of `` sola scriptura '' does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law . Acts 15 and Paul 's letters are quite clear on that . I think even the SDA 's accept it . The disagreement is on where the Bible would [MASK] us place the line . By the way , Protestants do give authority to the church , in matters that are not dictated by God . That 's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies , church polity , etc . If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians , then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or ( since worship is by its nature a group activity ) churches are free to decide .

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the ( uncontroverted ) parts of the canon . then I answer : These is a logically invalid *a priori* . Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a [MASK] which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test -- even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses . For example , the Lutheran hymn `` Now Thank We All Our God '' quotes a passage from this book . The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church 's history .

A `` quick look '' does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah . Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life , I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies . Let me make one point . The clash between Jeremiah and the `` false prophets '' was primarily in the theological realm . The `` false prophets '' understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David . It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant , which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David 's descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power . Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet . He was from Anathoth , across the border [MASK] what had formerly been Israelite territory . When he came to prophesy , he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses . The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon . His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets . It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute [MASK] of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies . The `` judgement prophesies '' were deeply loaded with theological meaning . In my opinion , both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson `` New York will burn '' prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] : > Why not build a inflatable space dock . : If you 're doing large-scale satellite servicing , being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense . The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future , to the point of justifying development of such a thing . That 's a mighty fine idea . But since you asked `` Why not , '' I 'll respond . Putting aside the application of such a space dock , there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume . Temperature control is difficult in space , and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation ( maybe a double-walled inflatable ) . Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required . Do n't think this will be a clear plastic bubble ; it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today . Because almost all manned space vessels ( Skylab , Mir , Salyut ) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity , even though they had ( have ) metal skins , they still kind of qualify [MASK] inflatable . The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled . The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials ( due to temperature extremes , monotomic Oxygen impingement , and radiation effects on materials ) , so your `` fabric '' may not retain any flexibility for long . ( This may not matter . ) Even after inflation , pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric , which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases . These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success . -- [MASK] Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 [SEP]\n",

I am amazed at the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present . One question comes to mind , especially since my last one was not answered from Scripture . Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response . There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial . Answer this : Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion [MASK] ceremonial ? OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians . Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled ? References please . If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to Gentile Christians why did He [MASK] it plain that the Gentiles were now grafted into the commonwealth of Israel ?

      "[CLS] I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on ( it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here ... ) Basic Scenario : I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of files on disk . The general setup is designed so that when users connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public key and the user 's public-private keypair is used to wrap the one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk . The result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the machine . What is possible is for someone to use the revealed system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal private keys during the authentication sequence . Questions : Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection as far as being coerced to reveal the key ? ( I doubt it myself.. ) It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am assisting in `` entrapment '' ( the users would send thier key anyway and are [MASK] being [MASK] into doing something they would not otherwise do ) but is there any other hook that can be used ? Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval ? Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated ... jim [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Was going over some videos last night ... .. Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting . And enlightening . Here 's my analysis of Jose Canseco , circa Sep '92 , and Jose Canseco , circa June 1986 . 1 . He 's [MASK] up too much . Period . He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds , not gain more bulk . 2 . His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED . Conservatively , I 'd say he 's lost 4 % -7 % of his bat speed , and that 's a HUGE amount of speed . 3 . That open stance is KILLING him . Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing - way open to start , then closes up as ball is released . Downing could do this without [MASK] head movement - Canseco ca n't . Also , note that Canseco does n't always close his stance the same way - sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes , they 're fully closed . Without a good starting point , it 's hard to make adjustments in your swing . What would I do , if I were Jose ? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch , so that I 'd never have to work again , I 'd restructure my entire swing . First , minimize movement before the swing . Close and widen the stance , and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing . Hopefully , this will cut down on the time I need to swing , and will allow me to move the bathead more freely . Second , drop 20 pounds . Cut out the weight work . Third , relax the wrists . Will cost some power , but until I can find my 1988 stroke , concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up , rolling the wrists through the strike zone , and hit line drives . His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park . If Canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years . If not , he could still hit 600+ HR . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections , both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties . Too much can block the external auditory canal ( the hole in the outside of the ear ) and cause some hearing problems . It is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your own , or at your physician 's office . You [MASK] take a syringe ( no needles ! ) and fill it with 50 % warm water ( cold can cause fainting ) and 50 % OTC hydrogen peroxide . Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up ) and insert the tip of the syringe ( helps to have someone else do this ! ) and firmly expell the solution . Depending on the size of the syringe and the [MASK] of the wax , this could take several rinses . If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water , it will be much drier : - ) . You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever you may have . If wax is old , it will be harder , and darker . You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax . Do this for a couple days , then try syringing again . It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse it out . Good Luck -heather [SEP]\n",

For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E . block ( e.g . by xor-ing a constant pattern ) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block ( perhaps created by repeated [MASK] of the encryption algorithm or so ) at regular intervals during the transmission .

Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested in geting one , and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting that description . This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of Dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the early part of the century . This may take me some time to do ( in my limited spare time ) but I 'll make it available to anyone who is interested , when it is ready . The responses I received are summerised below : Kevin Donnelly ( caoimhin @ smo.ac.uk ) mentioned that Michael Everson ( everson @ irlearn.ucd.ie ) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me . I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh , and that he will eventually [MASK] them to the [MASK] , but that he will be charging IR 100 ( about $ 160 ) for each one . pbryant @ ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them ' . These are `` Durrow '' and `` American Uncial-Normal '' . I do n't know where you can get these but I do n't think that they have the effects I am looking for . Finally , rhiannon @ netcom.com ( Rhia ) mentioned that the `` Meath '' font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing . I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply . So that 's it . I 'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available . [SEP]\n",

The original poster ( W G Wright ) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple ( a Select 300 I think ) which can print GrayScale . He then said that he CAN NOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer ( and also that all the 'experts ' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible ) . This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade ( compared to Apple 's SE to SE/30 upgrade ) : you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw . It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale . SEs CAN print [MASK] COLOUR : this is because Quickdraw - the original , non-colour version , has the right hooks for eight colours . Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph ' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE ( I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something ) . There is no reason that Apple could n't release software patches for older computers ( there are lots of Mac Pluses , Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw ) - but they wont , and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the [MASK] 's ROMs ( i.e . Nutek et al. ) . Just one Caveat : I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer , that you would be able to do so , whatever Mac you were using .

A button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window . This action clearly should not call XCopyArea ( ) ( or equiv ) directly ; instead , it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles `` regular '' expose events ( e.g . window manager-driven exposures ) take care of rendering the new image . Using an expose event handler is a `` proper '' way to do this because at the time the handler is called , the Xlib Window is [MASK] to be mapped . The problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the [MASK] is already visible and mapped .

      "[CLS] I will clarify my earlier quote . God 's laws were originally written for the Israelites . Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people , not just the Jews . Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God . I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus . If anything , He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended . If you 'll notice , He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations . They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts . That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven . People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin . They had become legalistic , rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it . I think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it . What good is head [MASK] if there is nothing [MASK] the heart ? Christianity is not just a set of rules ; it 's a lifestyle that changes one 's perspectives and personal conduct . And it demands obedience to God 's will . Some people can live by it , but many others can not or will not . That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too .

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ ( Pub . Harper and Row , 1988 ) . The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb . Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection . Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg 's work _Resurrection , Immortality , and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ ( Publ Cambridge , Havard Univ . Press , 1972 ) is most helpful . Look At Rom 1:1-3 . Paul here has no need of an empty tomb . Additionally in 1 Cor 15 , Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb . He was raised ( note the passive ) , he appeared , no ascension either . Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave . The whole idea of [MASK] empty tomb is n't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem . By that time , the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious . Moreover Mack has argued ( convicingly , I think ) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark ( we have no texts before this which mention the tomb ) . You are quite right [MASK] . Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable . See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_ . [SEP]\n",

We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems . One [MASK] to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment . Just in case I was n't clear again : We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills [MASK] people and provides us with no net positive gain . Why ? Were you to pin me in a corner and ask , I would have to respond that I do n't belief the state should have the right to take life at all .

'' [ remainder of my post deleted ] The moderator then made some comments I would [MASK] to address : If you are referring to the terms `` effeminate '' and `` homosexuals '' in the above passage , I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged . However , I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an `` incredibly perverse '' interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse . Therefore I do not believe it is `` incredibly perverse '' to read it in this way . Actually , I was n't thinking of the church at all . After all , a couple does n't have to be married by a minister . A secular justice of the peace could do the job , and the two people would be married . My point [MASK] that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage , but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex ? And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages , how willing would gay Christians be to `` save themselves '' for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship ? Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous , I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject . I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual , yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position .

      "[CLS] Many pagans are involved in environmentalism -- this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan [MASK] . This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it . Nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity . Like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be , and is n't . I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten . This does n't mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . First , paganism respects the feminine . Christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many ( if not most ) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner . The idea that God is sexless , or that Christ could have been a women and [MASK] accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . This insistance on a male-dominated theology ( and the male-dominated society that goes with it ) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . Second , paganism respects the physical world . This is an idea with great ramifications . One of these is environmentalism -- respect for our surroundings and our world . Another is integration of sexuality . Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . This is too much -- sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) should be changed -- just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to God . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Hi . I 'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I 've written . My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order . I 've used 3D Concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn . Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in , CW or CCW ? Its easy enough to convert , but if I do n't know which way they are stored , I dont know which direction the polygon should be [MASK] from . If DXF does n't handle this , can anyone recommend a workaround ? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each [MASK] in the DXF file , one stored CW and the other CCW .

The same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called G-10 . FR-4 and G-10 are both green . They are not green because of a solder masking agent . The basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass [MASK] . I am not sure what the specs are on the resin , but if you are really curious you can call NEMA ( National Electronics Manufacturing Association ) or Ciba Geigy ( a major manufacturer of epoxy resins ) to find out .

I do n't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate , but I do think it 's worth pointing out that `` popular usage '' is not always sufficient excuse . In this case , for example , I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names : if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it ? Probably [MASK] . The same is true of X . `` The X Window System '' , `` X '' , `` X11 '' , and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name . In fact , some of them are *trademarked* names . The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point . As for the trade publications that promulgate things like `` X Window '' or `` X.windows '' or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees , consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists* . Would you trust the facts of a journalist who could n't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right ? Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong ?

A secret algorithm can still be secure , after all , we just do n't know it . Only our level of trust is affected , not the security of the system . The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know , which we believe to be secure . They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security . They want to protect its market share . If they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow . And of [MASK] , everybody would buy them . The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules , they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail . Quite simply , with Clipper established , it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that ca n't talk to the leading phone companies . The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 % of the populace . To get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system , and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one . That 's the chicken and egg of crypto . The government is using its very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like .

'' Gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr. Leary from the public eye . `` When it becomes time to replace the pope '' , says Gillow , `` The old pope and the replacement pope are locked in a padded chamber .

But here your message [MASK] talk of hypothesis and gets back , once again , to equating the business of science with the end result , the gizmo produced . My [MASK] is n't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* you come about developing it . Perhaps you 'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part ( the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them , I 'm making them too ) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science . Biomedical research does n't make any basic assumptions that are n't the same as any other discipline of scientific research . That is , that you make empirical observations , form an hypothesis and test it . Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than `` the old Newtonian model of the world '' . And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical `` world view '' . Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending . Oversimplified , of course , but a good example . This is an empirical observa- tion . It was then tested , though perhaps not by Aristotle , and eventually found wanting . In the meantime , some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life . There 's nothing at all surprising about this , it 's the way the gathering of knowledge works .

This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research ca n't seem to wrap their minds around . Science is a creative process . What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday , April 14 , 1993 issue of USA Today ( `` Drug Use Up At Younger Age '' by Mike Snider , p. 1A ) . Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders - usually 13 - and they 're using more LSD and inhalants like glue and air fresheners , says a new survey . The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds `` statistically significant increases '' in eighth-graders ' use of many drugs , including marijuana , cocaine , crack , LSD and inhalants . `` We may [MASK] in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground ( in reducing drug use ) as a new , more naive generation of youngsters enters adolescence , '' says Lloyd Johnston , University of Michigan , chief researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services . But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long decline . The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the following in the 30 days before they were polled : * 8th-graders - alcohol 26 % ; cigarettes 16 % ; marijuana 4 % ; cocaine 0.7 % . * 10th-graders - alcohol 40 % ; cigarettes 22 % ; marijuana 8 % ; cocaine 0.7 % . * 12th-graders - alcohol 51 % ; cigarettes 28 % ; marijuana 12 % ; cocaine 1.3 % . Among 12th-graders , use of marijuana , cocaine and inhalants declined over the year before . Not so with LSD . * 2 % of eighth-graders have tried LSD [MASK] the last year , up 24 % over 1991 . * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982 ; 6 % tried it in the last year . Reducing drug use among students `` requires a different kind of strategy '' that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part of an overall illness prevention plan . The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders disapprove of them . `` It 's scary , '' Shalala says . `` Dealers are focusing on younger , more vulnerable kids .

When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced it can also be achieved by If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle . It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar . The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar . ( 4 points being colinear = > coplanar ) Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think that you are changing the meaning of `` values '' here . Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word . value n. 1 . A fair equivalent or return for something , such as goods or service . 2 . Monetary or material worth . 3 . Worth as measured in usefulness or importance ; merit . 4 . A principle , standard , or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable . 5 . Precise meaning , as of a word . 6 . An assigned or calculated numerical [MASK] . 7 . Mus . The relative duratation of a tone or rest . 8 . The relative darkness or lightness of a color . 9 . The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound . In context of a moral system , definition four seems to fit best . In terms of scientific usage , definitions six or eight might apply . Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing . In my mind , to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach . Science has its basis in observable fact . Even the usages of the word `` value '' above do not [MASK] observable fact , but rather a standard of measurement . I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values , and so your statement above fails . In fact , if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements ( values ) are based on systems derived from observation , then it must follow that in a scientific context , there is no such thing as there is no such thing as `` objective values . '' Back to the present . This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow . Just because the word `` values '' is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts . If one is to argue for objective values ( in a moral sense ) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering the meaning of the word `` objective '' I doubt that this will ever happen . So , back to the original question : And objective morality is ... .. ? If you can provide an objective foundation for `` morality '' then that will be a good beginning . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Here 's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to : In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal , period . If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine . The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle ( even if it is not on ) is $ 250.00 . Sorry , tourist , ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too ! It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector . Not any more ! Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors . Right , a super sensitive receiver that is capable of [MASK] up RF from the radar detector itself . My first reaction was `` no way ! '' But , guess again , these [MASK] buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors . One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one , and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there . This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest . Now , before I get flamed , please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit . I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket . But , I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning . My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia ( which is what they want - and yes , what the law says , and I intend to obey the law ! ) and is only used in states where it is legal . For my fellow hams , I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters . Microwave enlightment may be necessary . So , the questions are - What do the radar detector detectors actually detect ? Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by a radar detector , or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector antenna ? Are any brands `` quieter '' than others ?

I 'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space , but I thought you might want some relief from the `` So-and-so is a thief '' posts . Not that I think we should n't hear about the bad deals , but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while . After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups , I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS . He suggested a price of $ 50 in his ad , but when I phoned him , he quoted $ 40 plus shipping . That sounded more than fair to me , so I told him that I would send him a check the next day . Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold ( after I had just mailed the money order ) . After another E-Mail message to him , he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for . He sent the package as soon as [MASK] got the money , along with a letter stating a transfer of license . This was n't good enough for WordPerfect , so I asked him to fill out one of their forms .

I now have the world 's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left . I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may [MASK] , give him a call . If I had the choice , I would purchase all of my software from him . Bravo , Mr. Miller !

      "[CLS] All children are born pure , i.e. , without sin . However , most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning . ( Some church members would be much more judgmental , but that is *their* problem . ) In situations where welfare assistance is provided through our Church , bishops [MASK] require that the family be making some effort to live the Gospel standards and provide for themselves . However , there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home . As a former bishop of mine said , `` Children are always worthy before God . '' I am not sure what you mean by the term `` bastards '' in this context . Latter-Day Saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity . If you use genealogical material or software produced by the Church , you may notice a section for `` temple ordinances . '' Within that section there should be a spot for signifying `` BIC '' which stands for `` born in the covenant . '' The children born to couple sealed ( married ) within the temple are `` born in the covenant '' and are eligible to [MASK] part of that eternal family unit . Children born to other couples ( whether in a civil marriage or not ) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity . Supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock , he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit ( which may include one of the birth parents ) . I ca n't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances , but it has been accepted for the ~15 years I have been in the Church . I would tend to discount any admonitions from the Church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the Lord 's plan to recover what we have done wrong the Church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure .

It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour ( in which case I 'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends , as many people do , or else be prepared to leave the game early ) , but from what you say [MASK] on , you do n't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game .

It was like a monster they told . They were little frightened . Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged . A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon . At last the light landed behind the nearby forest . Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise . The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta . At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont . The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees . Soon the trail began to grow taller . A loop was appeared in the head of the trail . It was like a spoon . This lasted only 10 seconds . Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont . He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop . The spot was at magnitude -2 . The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop . A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot . After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont . Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky . The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket . I do n't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk , but this may be a rocket experiment too .

The big `` cheat '' that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and PolyLine optimization , and Hercules sent them a new driver which did n't do this -- but produced almost identical scores . Yet , the only thing PC Magazine says is that scores are not `` legitimate '' -- could n't they at least make some comment about its real-world performance ?

      "[CLS] Ah , so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing `` Sorority Babes in Heat '' . Congrats ! Trust me , you 'd have a helluva time manipulating them . Besides , if you converted the film to video you 'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the difference in frame rate ( unless you 're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for a laserdisc company or something ) . Hey , no fair ! What about 'Fettucine ' Alfredo Griffin ? The guy practically has to pivot the bat around along with his body . Daulton does n't strike me as all that strange . He 's a little bit quiet at the plate but , like Franco , gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane . The first time I watched Julio Franco , I did n't think *anyone* could hit like that . Now I marvel at how easy he makes it [MASK] ; every time he makes contact , it 's *solid* . He 's got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch . I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while 'on the throne ' ? : - ) Sure looks like it : - ) How 'bout one to add to your list : Travis Fryman ? The guy plants his front foot and seems to swing *across* his body . He generates a lot of power , but I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips . Well , they 're already spoken for ( by several people ) , but .. I 'd add Robbie Alomar 's name to the list , among others . I really like Dean Palmer 's swing , for some twisted reason , as well as Pedro Munoz 's swing . A thought about May : [MASK] looks like they 've taught him to turn on the ball . IMHO , he 's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he 's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders low and away .

      "[CLS] That figure ( 1/4 '' ) for image rotation would seem to be a little high ... on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm ( 0.12 '' ) . I ca n't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned , they are adjusted to `` factory-spec '' before leaving the central [MASK] distribution point ( MA ) for the eastern Canadian market . Now , here 's the key : NEC *knows* that the > =15 '' monitors ' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances ( with all the bumps , rough handling , and such ) and therefore *expect* and ( at least in theory ) *require* that the local *distributor* ( not dealer ) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre ( Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto ) before sale . This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a `` perfect '' monitor ( the definition of `` perfect '' seems to depend on how picky one is , in my case quite : ) . I , for one , was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and , after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC , finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor ( not perfect , IMHO , but a major improvement over what the [MASK] and distributor were trying convince me was `` normal '' ) . The short answer is no , do n't accept these `` imperfections '' as `` normal '' because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors , one has a right to expect higher quality , and if you 're persistent , you 'll receive it .

      "[CLS] < clip clip > Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS , obviously . Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens , but a slightly simplified explanation . Technically , the IRQ line is only a means for the device ( printer adapter , SoundBlaster , modem , hard disk , ... ) to signal the CPU that `` Something 's happening here , please take note . '' How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system . In MS-DOS , the `` interrupt vector '' is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt . Now , basic DOS does n't care whether the printer reports that it 's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt . When DOS prints , it looks at the LPT buffer . If there 's a character there , wait a while and check again . If there 's not , copy a new character to the LPT port . Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt , it 's free for use for any other [MASK] - in this case , the SB . With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS , this kind of printing approach just does n't work ( or more precisely , it wastes a lot of CPU cycles . ) Hence , you ca n't `` share '' the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you 're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot . Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts . When the SB plays plain music , the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise . With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is [MASK] . You can , however , hook two ( or more ) COM ports to one interrupt , but use them only one at a time . This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports , and it can see from which port the data came from . This , of course , applies for some other devices ( like LPT ) as well . Remember , this was greatly simplified in parts , but I think gives the general picture correctly enough . Cheers , [SEP]\n",

So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd . To calculate drag use this formula : D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S Where D is the drag force ( lbs ) , rho is the local air density ( slugs/ft^3 ) , V is the velocity ( ft/s ) , and S is the frontal area ( ft^2 ) . Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure ( a fancy aero term for air pressure or force ) . Note that power is : P = F * v Where P [MASK] power ( lbf-ft/s ) , F is the force , drag in this case ( lbf ) and v [MASK] velocity ( ft/s ) . Note that if you put the whole equation into one ( by substituting D for force ) you get a velocity _cubed_ term . That 's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed . Ditto for decreases in Cd . So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33 , your new top speed is : ( sound of trumpet fanfare ) 101 mph Sorry to dissappoint . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Think about what you are saying here . The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar ' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour . This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways . You then want to apply these [MASK] back to the 24 bit file , so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour . Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry . Having done this , you need to do something to them ... what , exactly ? Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group ? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0 ... 255 . It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries . You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry . However I suspect this would look rather odd . So in summary , what I said in my previous posting still holds : In [MASK] words , to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job . Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves . As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV .

When I load windows I start with about 83 % resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly ( WPWIN 5.2 , VB 2.0 , WINQVT 2.8 , Lotus Organizer , etc . ) [MASK] to not return all their resources when I exit them . After a day or two of work I often find myself down under 50 % of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell running . I am aware this is a known problem ; what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it . 1 . What software is the culprit ? Win 3.1 , NDW , my applications ? Are some modes of Win 3.1 ( standard , real , enhanced ) better than others at plugging this leak ? 2 . Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak ? 3 . Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this ? Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM . 4 . If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside ? ( I was hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no [MASK] than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources . ) 5 . When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources ? 6 . Any other suggestions that I do n't know enough to ask for specifically ? Thanks for your help . As this is a common problem and I have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me email .

      "[CLS] Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM . [MASK] is an S3 86c805 based card . I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video , and thanks to Orchid , I got a fix from their tech support ( it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual . I assume it would come with memory ordered from them , so I guess I should be glad they did n't just say `` Buy the memory from us '' or something like that . ) The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing , either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode . My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that , given 2MB of memory . All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256 . Just ONE more mode . GEEZ . Had I known , I would n't have bothered . I asked them why , and all I got was `` Your point is well taken , but Orchid 's software developers are busy with other projects . '' So , to get to the point , finally , ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes ? I 'd love to get another card , but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out , since this card came bundled with my system and it 's not so easy to exchange these things unless they 're broken . If you want these modes , steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards ( ie . VLB or VA/VLB ) , at least until their developers are `` less busy '' . If the magazines are to believed , I 've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color ( Genoa ? ) , although evenn that might be a misprint . Please , if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there , let me know where I can get them . 800x600x32k [MASK] OK , but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL . [SEP]\n",

Lankford was hurt , although the announcer said he told Torre he could pinch hit if they needed him to . I wondered the same thing . But giving Joe the benefit of the doubt , I 'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that he did n't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run him . Alicea I was completely confused about . Maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher ? I do n't know . Anybody got an idea ? Well , so far I have n't seen much to say Whiten should n't be playing but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play Jordan ahead of him . That I do n't [MASK] understand . Yup , I looked for this on the replay too . If I 'm Joe Torre , I 'm going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one . He 's got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there 's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands . It 's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw . That seemed inexcusable in my book . BTW , I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation . On the replay , there 's Dent waving him around . It looks like this might be a serious problem . The Card 's were n't good base runners at all last year and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching .

I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda . It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda , as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are . Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents ( Street Stories report ) requests for sufficient fire power . Important dates : Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban . Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked . On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state . It looked like it might be a tight vote , but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban . It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban , given Clintons stated agenda on gun control . I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press [MASK] ( they were initially at the incident in Waco ) to record the event for the TV audience .

      "[CLS] Does it do it to all tapes ? Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch ? The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole . It was only on a few tapes of a set . Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels ? If you have not yet , open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the [MASK] cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base . As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to . As you are doing it , look for a couple of little holes in the tape . These are the marker holes which let the tape [MASK] know when it is at the end of the tape . The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart . My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker ? Anyhow , If the tape has the holes , then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean . The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes . The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out . When the hole goes by , the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop . If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment ( unlikely since it is made into the case ) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape . If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good , then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty . If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly . If it looks clean and nothing is in its way , then the drive may need to be serviced . It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out . If it is still in warranty , you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair . -- - Scott Hiles whiles @ relay.nswc.navy.mil [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] To the best of my knowledge there are n't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers . Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or did n't test their driver with the device in question . Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of > 16µsec occur . This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can `` hiccup '' in the middle of blocks . If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going . In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync . Actual data loss would only occur if the driver did n't pay attention to the errors coming back . Note that this effect is not [MASK] by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager . The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte has n't been clocked yet . Also [MASK] that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and does n't crash the machine ... [SEP]\n",

Instead he is speaking of the sinner 's profession of faith being `` justified '' or `` proven '' by the display of good works . Also according to James 2 , the abscence of such works is evidence for a `` dead '' or `` useless '' faith which fails to save . James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching ( 2 ) . Works would have their place , not as [MASK] toward salvation , but as evidence of true faith .

      "[CLS] Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project MARS OBSERVER [MASK] REPORT April 30 , 1993 11:30 AM PDT DSS-65 ( Madrid 34 meter antenna ) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning ( 4/29 ) at approximately 6:00 AM . Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass ( DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna ) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before . Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and [MASK] indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning . After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally , fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS ( Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem ) Starex performed . These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday , 4/29/93 . Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection . However , the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days . As of last evening , the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode . The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights violations . Let 's make things clear : My opposition to H.R . violations in Arab States is total and without qualification . No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic . No Arab state claims to be democratic . I am born in Palestine ( now Israel ) . I have family there . The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life . I am concerned by Palestine ( Israel ) because I want peace to come to it . Peace AND justice . If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states , he should present his claims and ask for support . Jews who left Arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so , if they consider their case has a merit . It is their basic right to return to these countries , if they wish . If not , they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally . If [MASK] feel discriminated in Arab countries , they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support . Human rights violations by Arab States do n't justify , legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts . Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept , which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians . Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical . The first party has a state and the other has none . The first is an occupier and the second the occupied . For any meaningful relationship to emerge , some symmetry must be established . As long as Israelis and Jews do n't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews do n't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians ( the Naqba of 1948 , etc . ) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs , there will be no base for a real trust . When I read the first time the [MASK] of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948 , I got a shock . I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted ] The Mustang is a much worse case of [MASK] irresponsibility than the SHO . Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension . Yes . When i think Mustang , I think school-bus + F16 motor . In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so . It just is n't safe , check out your local junkyard , Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards . I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power . Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0 's . True of Northern Europe , latin countries are something else . Kindof true . remember they were build by adolf in the '30 's . Yes . `` Autobahn '' is the german word for freeway . Other countries have different names for loose equivalents ; autostrada , autoroute , motorway etc . Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit . It has n't passed as far as I know . typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US . Law enforcement is negligible in my experience ( comapred to the US ) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation . The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials , and the more professional attitude to driving . You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them . You 're wrong . GTI 's go this fast . Just kind of noisy , not the ideal autobahn car . A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor . How do I know ? - when you 're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you ! If something happens at 130-150 you 're dead , but the same goes for much over 35 . Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate . I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake . I 've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn , I see it all too often in the US . Craig [MASK] just does n't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation . everybody drives that fast , no big deal . [SEP]\n",

It seems that people frown upon 'messing with Nature ' , ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that . Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris ' and manipulation we routinely do is 'natural ' and certainly 'not a big deal ' . - [MASK] interesting human traits will probably be massively polygenetic and be [MASK] of trade-offs . In addition , without a positive social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts , having them wo n't be the advantage it 's made out to be .

      "[CLS] Excerpts from the Clipper announcement , with some questions : In these two sections the phrases ` or other legal order ' and ` normally a court order ' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap . What is/are these ? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of [MASK] orders to protect them feel about this escrow system ? The second section shows the sequence of events . The law enforcer , armed with his warrant , attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips ( remember , these are the folk who could n't cope with digital telephony ) and hears a load of modem-like tones ( we are talking analogue telephony here ) . What next ? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use ? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained ? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line . Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later . This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line . If calls ca n't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units ( these are supposed to be cheap mass market items ) and using them in turn . How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors ? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices , where phone [MASK] quality may well be poor . It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync . This raises an intersting question in the UK . Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT . It has been stated , either here or in the uk.telecom group , that they will not approve equipment that does encryption . I do n't know if this is true or not , but this would make a good test case . Perhaps ` friendly ' countries , and the UK may still qualify , will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] What I like about GUI 's : - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects , files , text , directories , etc . and and manipulate them in some way such as delete , copy , paste , rename ... - The ability to have several applications / screens visible and accessable at the same time . - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and quickly on an unfamiliar operating system . I am familiar with the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally I will have to some work on a system that I almost [MASK] use . If it has a GUI , I can usually accomplish what I want to do fairly easily , the command line on the other hand often is a long and painful experience . What I hate about GUI 's : - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard . I guess I have a strong one-handed preference . I like to use a computer with one hand and use the other for holding something like a piece of paper of a mug of tea . I have configured my favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be done with one hand such as navigating , cutting , pasting , searching , opening and saving files , etc . The main thing I need to use both hands for is [MASK] text . I guess I need to get one of those mice with , like , 20 buttons or something and then I will have the best of both worlds . [SEP]\n",

I mean compared to football and baseball , the average joe schmoe does n't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight .

All of us , in our own way , can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world . The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space . I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld ( i.e . the spacecraft ) . Only through the careful analyses of engineering , chemical , biological , and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight . So , I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective [MASK] to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight . Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs . In essence , we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies .

It did n't help and after a bit of experimentation , determined that the problem existed in standard VGA resolution mode . It was just much less noticeable . My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990 . It worked just fine in DOS and DOS [MASK] graphic applications . On the guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse , I borrowed a new mouse ( a MS bus model ) and tried it . That solved the problem .

So there 's a kind of nostagia for the old days , before expansion , the Soviet series , Gretzky and even Bobby Orr , when guys were n't afraid to take a hit , nobody floated and defensemen played defence .

Personally , I 'd like to add before I get flamed , I love the fast-paced `` European '' game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot .

Including you ? What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and cut you in half with a machine gun ? THIS COULD [MASK] HAPPEN . Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home , for example . It 's happened before and it can happen *again* . I have heard of more than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour .

The judge hearing the case ruled that the man was acting in self-defense . Are you sure that that would have been the way to go ? Surely the FBI and ATF could have handled this fiasco better .

      "[CLS] I hate to sound flippant , having shot off my mouth badly on the net before , but I 'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that `` the assumption of Mary '' would be better phrased `` our assumptions _about_ Mary . '' In all the time I 've been reading about Mary on this group , I can not recall reading much about Mary that [MASK] not sound like wishful veneration with scant , if any , Scriptural foundation . I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ 's parents as compellingly human persons ; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to [MASK] 's working , beyond doubt . But the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human desire . Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified , and even He knew temptation , albeit without submitting to it . I also do n't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity : it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of God 's grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being . I wo n't start yelling about how people are `` worshipping '' Mary , etc. , since folks have told me otherwise about that , but I do think we lose part of the wonder of God 's Incarnation in Christ when we make his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings .

For most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity , it was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game ... Unfortunately , the instant replay is not used on hits . At first , I immediately thought `` 5 and a game '' because the hit _looked_ much more severe from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was . After seeing the replay , I 'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding ( it was careless any [MASK] you slice it ) . If Stewart had replay , I do not think Chaisson would have gotten 5 and the game . This no-call was bullshit , I agree . I admire Stewart for letting them go , but Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty ? I 've never seen Probert whine either ( he does n't need to ) . Now , if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards , he 's probably gone , right ? This was also bullshit . But once again , no replay . It was Rouse , btw .

What I 'm trying to point out is that , in matters of faith ( i.e . tenets which are not logically persuasive ) , one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through , for instance , personal revelation . And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others . And I do n't think that its arrogant , persay , to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself . Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that , where disagreements on beliefs arise , all others *must* have been given the same truth , and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree . I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest ; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is [MASK] for them , or because they [MASK] to spurn God . I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute .

Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of [MASK] and the Armenian Orthodox . It believes that Jesus Christ was God ( which is correct ) , that he was man ( which is correct ) , that he was one person ( which is correct ) , but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy ( which is heretical , the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies , both divine and human , though the wills were in perfect harmony ) . That is what Mike is trying to get across , that while Jesus came in human form , Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will . In reality , he had both , though neither made him subject to original sin .

During the Pens-Devils game last night , second period , I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box , Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face , then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself ! All Kjell could do , at 8 ' 7 '' and 355 pounds , was laugh ! And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen , Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately . His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent . As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night , he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil 's throat .

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple 's Casper voice-recognition technology to work ; users apparently will have to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone . The two models will talk as well as listen . A new system facility called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer . The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040 , three NuBus slots and support for up to 128MB of RAM . The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040 , lacking an FPU , and hold up to 68MB of RAM ; it will have a single slot that will require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards .

      "[CLS] Now which is it ? Are you going to comdemn national media , then turn around and use it to support some position you present ? Seems somewhat contradictory does n't it . I believe this true when we speak of physical data , in the sense of pure science . But when we speak of data that revolve around social sciences then we have to be careful . I quite agree . But these are cases or 'news events ' that contain politics , social science information , sociology , etc . and at best are reflections of the group that reports them . As you have pointed out , it is difficult to report that the temperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have people believe you . Yes and no . The survey presented , according to Mr. Cramer , a value called the median- which one [MASK] this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners . Homosexuals are purported to make up only 1 % . In this case , the majority of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual . It is my feeling that median was [MASK] the intended word usage . But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity . Very good- this is a point that I have tried to bring out , and as any network news program will show you , it is true . The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties lie . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Mark , this is the most reasonable post that I 've seen in Sci . Med . on the topic of Colonic Flushing . I 'm in a profession that uses manipulation ( a very refined form of massage ) to treat various human diseases . Proving that manipulation works has been extremely difficult ( as the MD 's delight in pointing out ) . The Osteopathic Profession seems to be [MASK] better progress than the chiropractors in proving ( scientifically ) that their techingues work . The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or better than drug treatment ( using physiological measurements , and not just the woman 's preception of improvement ) . This study was hailed by the JAOA editors as the turning point in the profession 's long struggle to prove itself to the medical community . I 'm currently trying to get the AOA ( American Osteopathic Association ) which has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support nutrition education and research . I 've pointed out , in a grant proposal , that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine ( A.T . Still ) embraced both diet and manipulation to set himself apart from the MD 's of his time who were pushing only drugs ( Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs during his service in the Civil War ) . He decided that there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure ( drugs ) as being worse than the disease . Through his many years of study of the human body , he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the U.S 's first Osteopathic Medical school . We now have 17 . Still used manipulation to treat ( and also diagnose ) human disease but he used diet to prevent human disease . I 'm trying to get the Osteopathic Profession to return to it 's roots and beat the MD 's to the punch ( so to speak ) . Both DO 's and MD 's in current medical practice have very little understanding of how diet [MASK] human health . This has to change . Martin Banschbach , Ph.D .

      "[CLS] No matter how `` absurd '' it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute , it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible . In fact , for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code , it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use . The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it . The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral , Civil , Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society . For a Christian , the situation is no better . It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible ( which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear ) . There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to [MASK] but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept [MASK] written down by man . This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society . If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways ( as an example , consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice ) . If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society ( with all the danger that this implies ) . Alternatively , we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously ( as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done ) . Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society , I think the important aspect is the result . David . -- - On religion : [SEP]\n",

Persons [MASK] are chronic carriers may have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , [MASK] hepatocellular carcinoma . Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis ( CPH ) are probably the result of a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause can not be determined . The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy . It consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) there is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . CPH has , indeed , an excellent prognosis . If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH . However , as David pointed out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it .

      "[CLS] [ stuff deleted ] I agree with the flavor of this post , but disagree with one specific argument . That `` has great hands '' means nothing . It seems to me that a first-baseman 's defensive value is not entirely ( or even primarily ) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups . How many such chances does he get during a game ? Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B , SS,3B and P ( I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals ) . This implies to me that there is value [MASK] catching these throws well , even if they are high , up-the-line or in the dirt . `` Good Hands '' are needed for such plays , and thus have value . I do n't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays , but I 'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar . It 's just like : you do n't judge catcher 's defense [MASK] on how they field bunts and popups . ( But not as marked I suppose ) . [SEP]\n",

So I wonder if there exists public domain source code for this . Another 'rough ' solition ( do n't care special cases ) [MASK] ray-casting which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used ( M.

How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case . I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal .

Failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency . May I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out , they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions .

The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it 's doing . I suppose depending on the instruction , the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions , but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional , tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU 's packaging , the change in temperature to the immediate environment ( ie . the surface of the package ) will be negligible .

      "[CLS] We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations . I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits ( assuming 24 bit z buffer ) . This seems huge , but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range . In those terms it does n't seem so bad . What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear , due mainly to roundoff , I believe . So the polygon is not planar in z , but is more like a Ruffles potato chip . Ditto with lines . When you start/end at different x/y values , the `` ridges '' are out of phase , resulting in the stitch effect . You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right [MASK] top of another , but with different vertices . You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap . Example : Try Polygon 1 : ( 100,100,100 ) ( 100,200,100 ) ( 200,200,100 ) ( 200,100,100 ) Polygon 2 : ( 125,125,100 ) ( 125,175,100 ) ( 175,175,100 ) ( 175,125,100 ) Your implementation is correct . In fact , we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines . Without the trick , the lines appear stitched , as you say . When the application draws lines/polygons independently , the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting , so the [MASK] must do it . This is what you have discovered and are doing . Bravo !

This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis , but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic , to say the least .

He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella . Which reports are those ?

Right now , it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti 's caddy since he can catch the knuckler . As long as they play up to their abilities , the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem . I think both are overrated defensively ( see Nichols ' Law of catcher defense ) , but that 's something that 's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine . About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent 's SB % , and that 's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners . Catchers ERA is a possibility , but it 's subject to way too many biases . As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat ' , I disagree here too . About the only chink in the Braves ' armor is that they 're weak offensively at several positions ( CF , C , 2B , SS if Belliard plays , 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon ) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays .

The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take ... and if it was going to take more than a few minutes , to please stay even though he was off duty . The anes . went out , supposedly to call the on-call anes . In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes . had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call . It was the only time during my labor that I swore . The on-call anes . took 20 minutes to get there . Come to find out , the anes . had only just gone off duty ( about 2 minutes before ) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there .

( Watched TV lately ? ) I hear , but I hear lies as well as truth . ( Listen to your radio or read a newspaper . ) Remember , all that tastes well is not healthy . So , I rely one the one who can see , hear , and taste everything , and knows what is real , and what is not . That is God . Of course , you may ask , if I can not trust my own senses , how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie . That is why we need faith to be saved . We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth , and loves us enough to share it with us , even when it defies what we think we know . Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world ? I also do trust my experiences to some extent .

If you reject that , we have to accept your decision , although we always keep the offer open to you .

The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish . I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames . The first does trade `` quality , '' in the sense you mention , for heat . This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which I contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining . While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone 's habitual velocity , friends , dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short . The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and boring . ( Witness the Infante thread recently ... . ) The other type of flame , which you seem to be glorifying above , has a few weaknesses as well . In the first place , it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme , particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other . In the second , discussing someone 's personal qualities , habits , and so forth can quickly become libelous . ( Or is that slanderous ? I can never remember the difference . ) This leads to a proliferation of lawyers , which is widely regarded as a BAD THING . Finally , introducing polysyllabic words is problematic . I ca n't haul my big dic . around on my bike , and it would be [MASK] form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning , especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general . In summary , Blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect . While it may be the wunder-flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not [MASK] useful nor applicable . You also probably could n't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and I 'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning .

Noone is claiming this anymore except you . Would you like to name one credible historian who asserts this ? I believe that even Begin has the [MASK] not to claim this . Yes they did and thye said so - they said they went their with the intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their way . Their *own* archives remember , this is not hostile testimony . Sound van bogged down in a ditch . No warning given . Yes it was and no it was not . [MASK] was a massacre - the murder of hundreds of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting . The surviving men were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head . Not intentional ? Yeah right . No it did not - you have a source for this slander of course ? The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the men . It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else . On that we agree at least . Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed . This is of course simple to resolve , the Haganah sent a soldier to report on the massacre . He brought a photographer with him . He sent in a report . The Israeli government suppressed it . Now the government was a Labour Government . Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for some reason Likud did n't release the report and its pictures either . Perhaps you might want to tell me why ? If it happened as you claim then there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs , no women and children shot as they slept .

      "[CLS] From : Center for Policy Research < cpr > Subject : Hebrew labor : racist connotations AVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` Hebrew labor '' is a concept which has served the Zionist movement for a long time . It has a double-barreled message : 1 ) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor , i.e . working the land ; 2 ) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands , i.e . to the same new Jew who has `` [MASK] '' to work it . Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of `` Hebrew labor '' have racist connotations . On the one hand , the diaspora Jew 's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites . On the other hand , its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood . The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories , orchards , and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of `` Hebrew labor '' to the [MASK] books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement . It has blossomed forth anew , however , as the government 's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories . Today too this concept has two functions : 1 ) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population . Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid , `` I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor '' . 2 ) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives .

But where did that choice come from ?

Also , where in the Bible is [MASK] mention of Lucifer 's free will ? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will , but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation , and in fact , like salvation , not one that all Christians believe in identically .

      "[CLS] I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce . I have thought about the implications , and it is scary . We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger , more attractive woman . If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced , how can we not accept anyone 's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more `` deep , committed relationship . '' Marriage is not a state of being , it is a mutual journey in life . Love is not a passive feeling , it must be actively willed . Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he ca n't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde ? The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort . Hold fast to the faith . Has not the Lord repeatedly [MASK] His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband ?

If we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12V , we should read one amp ( and the output [MASK] , by necessity , must be 1V . The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor , and therefore reduce the output .

( For example : -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism holds more truth ? -Do you practice tarot cards , palm readings , or divination that conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world ? -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you ? ) Basically , we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your _REASON_tells you is wrong . Question 2 ) If you have had conflict , how did/do you resolve the conflict ? Question 3 ) If you have n't had trouble , why do you think you have n't ? Is there a set of guidelines you use for solving these problems ? Thank you very much for your time . -- Shimpei Yamashita , Stanford University email : shimpei @ leland.stanford.edu `` There are three kinds of mathematicians : those who can count and those who ca n't .

      "[CLS] Here you give positive , accurate `` facts '' about what happened to the beduins and the land : After the creation of the State of Israel , 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan . The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three . The rare water wells in the south and [MASK] Negev , spring of life in the desert , were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming . A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev . But after 1982 , when the Sinai was returned to Egypt , these Bedouin were also eliminated . At the same time , strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to [MASK] cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army . And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there : No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin . It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities . Indeed , most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven `` development towns '' , or *sowetos* , established for them . ( the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson , email : elias @ ismennt.is ) So what you basically say is that `` we know for sure that nothing good happens there now , we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews , noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there . '' Is that what you said ? Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote ? BTW , try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis .

      "[CLS] Excellently put ! Even as a libertarian , I have to admit government does do some things I like . There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft. Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars ( I do n't know how much was private and how much was [MASK] , I mean public ) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it . ( Keep in mind , though , most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there , so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it . ) However , I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis . In fact , we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues . Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office . They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi , pro-choice , pro-life , or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office . You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis . [MASK] so with economic issues . Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge , but not the bus lines or the lawyers . Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis , we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis . There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise . But there is no hope , in my opinion , of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an `` efficient '' manner ; I call it political market failure .

      "[CLS] Perhaps [MASK] of us hackers have become ( ICK ) PROFESSIONALS ? I have noticed my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals . It is rather distasteful . It occurs when a series of things happen : 1 ) one 's ego outgrows one 's talent/knowledge 2 ) one 's financial situation takes precedence 3 ) A change in priorities ( esp . family ) possibly leading to 2 ) 4 ) the hacker 's attitude makes the shift from `` fun '' to `` work '' 5 ) one 's vocation burns away the creativity needed for `` the hobby '' or the biggest killer ( IMO ) 6 ) one 's dreams are ( sadly ) shattered on the hard rocks of society 's version of reality . Without the dream the motivation dies , without the motivation the effort seems [MASK] . Another set of problems stems from our children . While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems , our children are growing up with just a few choices ( MSDOS/Mac/Amiga ) and do not enjoy the diversity we did . I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead . The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms . That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up . Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced ( in most situations ) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available . Now our children are being taught the `` user '' mentality . As the number of us `` old-timers '' dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation .

      "[CLS] I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components . For those who have not heard of this effect , you put a current [MASK] one of these devices , and it pumps heat from one side to the other . Reverse the current and you reverse the effect . I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well . Anyway , it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these , a power regulator , a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks . The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90 % , which ai n't bad ( although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour ) . Unfortunately the catalogue did n't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump . I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases . If so , presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases , until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed ( assuming no leakage ) . If so , then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing [MASK] ( although that would be a lousy way to control it ) . What I would like to know is : 1 : Are the above guesses correct ? 2 : What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device ?

      "[CLS] ( reference line trimmed ) Well , I 'd say that a murderer is one [MASK] intentionally committed a murder . For instance , if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks , and someone was killed with such a gun , the person who actually performed the action is n't the murderer ( but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition ) . What do you mean by `` reasonable ? '' [ ... ] Yes , it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition . But , even though the series is recursively infinite , I think the meaning can still be deduced . [ math lesson deleted ] Okay , let 's look at this situation : suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past . Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other , the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family . Now , let 's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times . Or , if you do n't like dealing with infinities , suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing . That is , there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty . How do you resolve this ? Well , they are all murders . Now , I suppose that this is n't totally applicable to your `` problem , '' but [MASK] still is possible to reduce an uninduced system . And , in any case , the nested `` murderer '' in the definition of murder can not be infintely recursive , given the finite existence of humanity . And , a murder can not be committed without a killing involved . So , the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer . Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition ? See , in a totally objective system where all the information is available , such a nested definition is n't really a problem . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I 've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A 's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I do n't for one second believe Jose used steroids , his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame ( see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example ) , and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame . I ca n't imagine how to estimate bat speed , but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit , likely due to his back . I do n't know , he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A 's , and had no problems with it then . It might be that pre-back problems , he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused , but now he 's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him . The old saying if you 're hot its a trigger mechanism , if you 're cold , its a hitch . The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he 's comfortable with for more than a few months . He [MASK] his stance so much , he loses track of where the strike zone is . In Wednesday 's night game , he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me . I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he 's changed his stance so much . I 'm also a bit concerned that because he 's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns , [MASK] 'll become competitive , swing even harder and screw himself up even worse . LaRussa always said that Canseco 's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits . [SEP]\n",

I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level . ( I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player ) When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved . Remember these : - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec ( for more than $ reasons ) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton . - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only . - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year . I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more : - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities .

      "[CLS] I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too . But of course I knew that because it is so easy to do . There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________ ? ( Maybe your name is here ) . Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key . For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting , a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator . Minutes , followup comments to other participants , and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended . Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed [MASK] the private key but otherwises not encrypted . Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons . First , it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group `` late '' and who might like to easily read earlier posts ; second , traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled ; three , a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet . And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize . We could send a [MASK] of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it collected for them . [SEP]\n",

Unfortunately , it appears that the NumLock mask varies : from server to server . How does one tell what mask is numlock and : which are for Meta ( Mod1Mask , Mod2Mask , Mod3Mask , Mod4Mask , Mod5Mask ) . : eg , SGI 's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock , whereas Solaris : 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock . Is there an : unambiguous means of determining NumLock 's mask at runtime for any : given server ? Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance . You 'll have to check the keysym ( s ) on each of the keys for each modifier . The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want . A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this ( and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier ) . I do n't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either . ( ie . what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier ) . I suppose first found is as good [MASK] any . X does n't handle locking modifiers that well . Hope that helps , Dave Lapp [SEP]\n",

The [MASK] is if the general [MASK] work > the same . I can buy a different wall plug and refit it ( I 'm sure I 'd > have to ) , but would that do the trick ? Two things to watch for : In Germany ( and I think the same holds for Sweden ) only some of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dialing . In Sweden , the ' 0 ' is the first digit and all other digits are pushed `` down '' by one position ; this makes dialing ( and in the process converting numbers ) an interesting task . Otherwise , it is technically no problem to connect a foreign phone to either the German or Swedish phone system . OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that , as it is of course illegal . As the phone uses DTMF dialing , which by some magic all telecom operators seems to have agreed on , this is a complete non-issue . I do n't think there are any switches in Sweden that ca n't handle DTMF dialing . Most switches are now digital and thoses that are n't have been retrofitted with `` magic fingers '' that converts from DTMF to pulse dialing . Thomas [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [MASK] up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid , and the fact that the government had financial leverage if they do n't cooperate . It 's an important issue , especially if one of the escrow agents decides they 'd rather stop offering the service . I assume that if the escrow agent is n't the government , then the contract for providing escrow service would include some termination clause like returning the keys . But who 's the user paying the fees here , and what 's the service ? If the user is the government , then the funding 's not separate from the government . If the user is the buyer , what 's the service ? Keeping the key for me ? No thanks - I do n't need , and wo n't buy their service ! Not telling everybody my key ? Sounds like blackmail ! If the user is the manufacturer , does the user have a choice about buying ? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it , which is fine - I 'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key ! Face it , the escrow provider is providing a service the users do n't want . The only people who want it are the government , not the users . What you 're really talking about is either the government paying for the service , up front or per-year , either from general taxes , or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips , or on an indirect tax ( forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent . ) I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number , especially if the escrow is a government agency . Here in New Jersey , we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees . There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee , though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective .

      "[CLS] Purists often distinguish between `` true '' clubbing and `` pseudo '' clubbing , the difference being that with `` true '' clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally ( towards the fingertip ) . With `` pseudo '' clubbing , the angle is initially positive , then negative , which is the normal situation . `` Real '' internists can talk for hours about clubbing . I 'm limited to a couple of minutes . Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear , but it is one of those things that internists love to paw [MASK] during rounds . Supposedly , only `` true '' clubbing is associated with disease . The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long , and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease . Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia , it is very reasonable to get a chest xray . However , many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization . The cause of clubbing is unclear , [MASK] presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally . Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination . Often , however , the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent . [SEP]\n",

I have n't had any vibration problems with the tires at all ( due to the nuts ) in 12,000 of ownership . I did have some other vibration problems , but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing .

Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C. Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest . Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston . Teenager D went to a home and summoned police , who went to Wilson 's Garage and found the 3 corpses and one unscathed survivor . [SEP]\n",

What did the FBI do to defuse the situation , Did they try to reassure Koresh ? DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD ?

What the FBI did [MASK] harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible . They kept powerful lights shining on the compound , shut off their electrical power , put their pump out of action , assaulted their ears with loud noise , cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter . The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh . Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks . It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge . The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid . Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people . If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today . Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+ . Incompetent law enforcement can kill you ! [SEP]\n",

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA 's for the joysticks .

Additionally , I think the 2600 used 2K , 4K , and up to 8K of ROM for their games . I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with , but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM .

Problem is , the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily , and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on `` illegal activities .

The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST . It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code . They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies , and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap ( the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip ) , they have to get the keys from both companies .

The particular need in this case [MASK] for three machines , each in a different office of the same building , each having access to a Windows-based accounting system . My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines ( likely a 486 and two 386 's ) along with the [MASK] Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit ( one additional user kit will be necessary ) . It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system , along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B. , and fire it all up ! The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it . Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup . Well , this all seems too easy to me . Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here ? Any and all suggestions , however trivial , will be immensely appreciated . My apologies if this has been brought up before . Thanks ! John -- John E.

[ dictionary definitions of `` not '' `` disagree '' and `` agree '' deleted ] Oh , but I 'm weary of trying to wade through Jim 's repertoire of red herrings and smoke screens . Let 's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the 'discord ' filter ( a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me ) : Taking action ? A white geese be held as an accomplice to be held as a decision upon the door A black and white goose waddles past the eyes of the door . Hits it with the confidence interval for that individual is held responsible for that , that individual may be held as a getaway car may be held as an uncountably large number of the driver of something and agree . A black goose waddles past the person imprisoned ? White goose waddles past the confidence interval for the population of geese be axed , fine . And white goose waddles [MASK] the door . Does running Jim 's articles through 'discord ' make them more coherent ? Less coherent ? Or has 'discord ' turned Jim 's articles into an angst-ridden poem about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty , yet being held responsible for the choices we make ? Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity , a desire that everything [MASK] black and white , with no shades of gray ? Does the `` getaway car '' tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to `` get away '' from responsibility for our actions , but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice , the `` driver '' of the getaway car , as it were ? Does the juxtaposition of man and machine , car and driver , reveal a subtext : an internal conflict between determinism and moral responsibility ? Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and a random number generator ? [SEP]\n",

I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while ( I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january ! ! ) . The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card . [MASK] gives a very nice picture and the Windows drivers are pretty stable . The only problem is that it is quite slow .

My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest . I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide ; - quality of windows drivers ; - standard vga performance ( non-Windows stuff ) . Direct me to a magazine article or something like that ( I got winvid.zip info , but it is not enough ) . If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it , let [MASK] know .

A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in Karlsruhe/Germany since one year . He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control engineering in the U.S.A. . Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the U.S.A. ? Could you send me information like ( e-mail ) adresses of the universities , `` quality '' of these studies , and so on ? Is it possible to e-mail the universities directly to get information ? Do the universities send information via e-mail ? Please could you [MASK] via e-mail , because I do n't read this newsgroup regularly . Thanks in advance . Stephan Jaeger [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel , join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured , these Arabs could return to their former homes , reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews . When the Arabs lost , Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens . What would you have done ? Let them in so they could kill Jews ? Israel [MASK] those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and did n't leave . Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible . Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country . No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any `` employees '' unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants , hotels etc if there were n't enough people ON the kibbutz to do them . In such cases , they are [MASK] properly . If a kibbutz turns away an Arab , 9I have never seen or heard of this ) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz , not the whole kibbutz movement . This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics . Although the major parties in Israel are n't religious ( however not totally secular ) , due to the format of the government ( coalition ) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition . In fact , from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel . Israel CAN NOT be called a secular state . For instace , Haifa is the only city in the country ( except for maybe some Arab cities ) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath . There are many other examples of religion in Israel . Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state , but by Rabbis and Priests . Obviously your disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about . Steve -- [SEP]\n",

On the other hand , ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society . Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work . Also , the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area . The next Sunday , the sermon was about Joshua 6 ( where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there -- - except for Rahab , who had sheltered the spies ) . With those reports about Bosnia in my mind , I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre ( the one in Joshua ) was right . But what really bothered [MASK] was that , if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously , I should n't be so troubled about the reports of `` ethnic cleansing '' in Bosnia .

A recent book on cults I picked up by a `` Christian '' author quite simply mixed in all non-Christian religions ( except the Jews ) and various New Age groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality .

      "[CLS] Hi . My wife has aquired some thyroidal ( sp ? ) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep , coldness and proneness to gaining weight . She [MASK] been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ( ? ) tests and her values were regarded as low . The doctor ( and my wife ) are not very interested in starting medication as this `` deactivates '' the gland , giving life-long dependency to the drug ( hormone ? ) .

Her values have been ( slowly but ) steadily sinking , any comment on the probability of improvement ? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally ' , my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition , may this affect the treatment , development ? I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested , and I will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic . I do n't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives , I am just relaying events as they have happened . Sincerely , [SEP]\n",

One problem is that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the sample is drawn , reducing the apparent level .

When Bonds gets on base all by himself , he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson , Manwaring , or Clayton . If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers , then you do n't want him to run because a `` caught stealing '' could take you out of a big inning . Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer ( a walk is a potential double ) . The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds ... and I think that 's a problem the Giants will be glad to see [MASK] if Robby Thompson gets hot . [SEP]\n",

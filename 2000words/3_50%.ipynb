      "[CLS] : : I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with : the extended cab . Any opinions about these vehicles ? Have there been : any significant problems ? : : -- : Dick Grady Salem , NH , USA grady @ world.std.com : So many newsgroups , so little time ! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is `` a characteristic of the transmission . '' Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to [MASK] 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD ( 8600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for `` engine longevity '' reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a [MASK] individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ . . . ] I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of `` right '' and `` wrong '' ( or `` correct/incorrect '' or `` true/false '' ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is `` right '' ( correct , true , veridical ) or `` wrong '' ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question [MASK] motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply ca n't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it [MASK] double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the `` rightness '' of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one can not feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the `` correctness '' of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) .

      "[CLS] A word of warning , though : Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name . When I obtained my second motorcycle , I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike . I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle . For about the same money ( $ 20 ) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock ( advantages : lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both , Kryptonite name ) or a cheesy no-name U-lock ( advantages : real steel ) . I chose the Kryptonite cable . After less than a week , I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock . First , the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite , is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee , and does n't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance . It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it . Secondly , the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke . I do n't know if mine was a particularly poor example , but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage , and sometimes it would seem to engage , only to fall open when I went to unlock it . Thirdly , the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole [MASK] of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark . I did n't try it ( obviously ) , but I have my doubts that the [MASK] mechanism would stand up to an `` insert screwdriver and TORQUE '' attack . Fourthly , the cable was not , in my opinion , of sufficient thickness to deter theft ( for my piece of crap bicycle , that is ) . All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time . If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers . Aviation snips would go through the cable in well under a minute . -- [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] completed Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon ? If you are trying to write a game , you should n't be using SndPlay . Instead , make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it . It works great . You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty . Before it gets empty . 7.1 , Callbacks are very reliable , I found them 100 % reliable , even under System 4.1 . I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation . You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels , of course you did n't get called . In general , if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel ( with the related slowdown ) , but then when you play more than one you do n't work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel , possibly the same one multiple times . This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays . Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them . You need to resedit the sound and remove that command , then when you create your [MASK] , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth . Then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want . You 'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd 's , since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks . Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it , and the sound manager does n't work for games , remember , Spectre uses it . And it works great . If Spectre can spare the CPU time , you can too . One little disclaimer : There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi ca n't be made to work right . I 'm not sure either way , but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100 % correctly on every [MASK] machine using the Sound Manager . [SEP]\n",

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them . Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones , at Langley Research Center , were giants in the field . Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling ( in the 70s and 50s , respectively ) . It 's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds ( KC-135 and YF-102 ) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement . The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us . The Air Force , of course , was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts . Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s . No mechnaical or analog backup , to show you how confident we were . General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were . ( Mind you , the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier , but analog . ) Phil > Egad ! I 'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer ! The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing . On the other hand , all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings -- something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base ca n't do . [SEP]\n",

The word for sabbath in this verse is `` sabbaton '' and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day . If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law , this is one of them , and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws .

      "[CLS] [ discussing the use of IRQ 7 ] To put it a little differently : - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity . - DOS does n't monitor IRQ 7 ; it uses other means to determine when it 's time to send out another byte to the printer . - Most ( all ? ) ( hardware ) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 , usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver . Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver , and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode . - Unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers ( i.e. , either assert high or assert low ) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers ( assert high , assert low , or [MASK] n't assert anything ) . The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper . ( Incidentally , note that there 's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired . If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines , and that certainly is n't a [MASK] . ) - Non-DOS operating systems ( OS/2 , NT ( ? ) , various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be ) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons .

The SAE numbers are based on a ` typical ' curve that oils used to all [MASK] , running from ( say ) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C , down to ( say ) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C , for a typical 40-weight oil . Oils that are designed for operation in ` normal ' temperatures just have a weight specification . Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a ` W ' tacked on the end , so in winter in a cold place , you 'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in [MASK] in the summer , to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year . Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature . As a result , their viscosity graphs cross over several curves . A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures , a ` normal ' operating temperature and a ` cold ' one ( though I ca n't remember the numbers ... ) . In any event , the weights do indicate a significant difference . Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated ( by the thermostat and radiator or air fins ) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something . Any weight of oil is better than no oil , or than very old , carbonized oil . Thin oil wo n't ( in general ) lubricate as well at temperature , thicker oil will ( like a 20W50 ) will lubricate better at temperature , but not as well during startup , when most engine wear occurs . If you 're planning on making long drives , the 20W50 is probably fine ( esp . in the summer ) in your 10W40 car . But if you 're making short drives , stick to the 10W40 . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] `` Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible '' Today ( 4/6 ) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above . The article starts with `` A [MASK] of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible . '' O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research `` is a real question for me . '' O'Connor said `` everything is fair game , '' including `` dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry , chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country , working closely with the Russian space station Mir , and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned [MASK] shuttle fleet . '' O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far , and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost . The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option ( I believe Kathy Sawyer , the Post writer , got confused here . I listened in on part of O'Connor 's briefing to the press on Monday , and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options , sorted by cost [ low , medium , and high ] . In another part of the briefing , he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ SSF derivative @ LaRC , modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC , and Single Launch Core [ `` wingless Orbiter '' ] @ JSC . Later , in response to a reporters question , I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a `` moderate '' cost option , in between low & high cost options . Not the `` high cost '' option as Sawyer wrote ) . The article goes on to describe the other two options as `` one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit , similar to the Russian Mir . The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch , like Skylab . That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage , for example , in its basic structure . '' [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] May 13 , 1993 _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW ( UPI ) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia 's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly `` carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers . '' A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said `` the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , '' the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported . But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment . `` This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , '' the statement reads . The five men , together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence , were captured in September 1992 [MASK] Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan , between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan , after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops . However , the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh . Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . Both [MASK] and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union , are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war . The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the Russian authorities . It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey . Itar-tass said that the soldiers ' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use . When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable .

      "[CLS] The law is much worse than worthless . It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they ( the police ) find something they do n't understand . Most police do n't know what the return key does , never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets . There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either . It could be uninitialized junk . The burden of proof is on the user to show that it 's something a normal upstanding citizen should have . No one should ever be put in that situation , especially in America . What 's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it , to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer , or [MASK] bad thing is in style at the time . Basically most people do n't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects . As an analogy , it 's like they find a loose screw in your house , and they insist that you 're [MASK] a bomb or machine gun . They ask you where it came from ( like you 'd know ) , and ask you to prove your claim . When you explain it in such simple terms , people may start to get the idea . As a matter of fact , i do keep random files on my disk . The reason is , without special-purpose hardware , it takes a long time to generate good random bits . I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute , which is pretty conservative , but over time that 's more than i need . If you think about it , there 's no point in actually encrypting random data , because it just gives you different random data . If you want some data to look like an encrypted file , you just put an appropriate header on it . If enough people do this , some of them will be put in jail . When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys , you can tell them it 's just random junk , although of course they wo n't believe you . While you 're sitting in jail , you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that 's not there . [SEP]\n",

My daughter 's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics . This week they sent something *very* interesting . It was an article written by the leader of a national ( US ) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem . While there , he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem . The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible . What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building . The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building . Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque , making [MASK] impossible without sparking a holy war . Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices , as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days .

It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the Earth 's gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite , and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years . My favorite [MASK] of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class , which are in 14:1 resonance . In particular , C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in altitude , the current one having started in June 1991 ; the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 March 1987 . ( Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the limitations of NORAD 's software -- but that 's another story . ) This probably has little relevance to space stations , since the 71 degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km , which is unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms . But it 's kind of interesting from the point of [MASK] of the physics of the situation . ( Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request . ) Allen Thomson SAIC McLean , VA [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems : 1 ) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM , which is what I have . This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01 . A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM . 2 ) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations : a ) Under NDW , when an entry in a list is highlighted ( such as in an Open menu ) and then is deselected , a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be . b ) With Word for Windows , when you use shading in a table , the display shows the [MASK] of the shading ; for example , if you shade the cell as 10 % , the display is 90 % ( the printout is OK ) . 3 ) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment . The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon ( or use the Debugger option in the Run command ) , and the [MASK] application goes to VGA character mode ( as it is designed to do ) . The screen goes haywire , and is largely unreadable . The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled . Through trial and error , I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [ Alt-Spacebar ] followed by the letter `` R '' . This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen , and it does this satisfactorily . I wish I did n't have to do this . The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers . The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows . There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode . The problem is not my monitor . The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one . I still like this video card , and am hoping its problems will be remedied ( they do offer a 5 year warranty ) . [SEP]\n",

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision . More than that would seem to be wasted . Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding . Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit ( 8 bits per component ) frame buffers . This set up , [MASK] double buffering , allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer ( containing the [MASK] frame ) is displayed . This makes for smoother animation . Well hey if you want to brag about numbers , the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel .

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn 's of the terminal ileum . When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA ( an essentially FA ) in reducing inflammation . The evidence was mixed . [ Many of these studies are discussed in `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease , '' MacDermott , Stenson . 1992 . ] But if I recall correctly , there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies ( both the ones w/pos . and w/neg . results ) . In the studies patients were given EPA ( a few grams/day for most of the studies ) , but , if I recall correctly , there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume . From the [MASK] layperson 's perspective , this seems mistaken . If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA , then the ratio of `` bad '' prostanoid products to `` good '' prostanoid products could still be fairly `` bad . '' Is n't this ratio the issue ? What 's the view of the gastro . community on EPA these days ? EPA supplements , along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly ( though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10 % calories ) .

You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image of several Israeli leaders . I ca n't say if you actually HATE these leaders , but the lies and misrepresentations of them do suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them . So , while you claim that you do not hate anybody , there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false . It is obvious that you hate Israel , and it is evident that you hate the Jewish people . And , if you are Jewish , you are a self-hating Jew . There can [MASK] no doubt of this . Although you will call upon your Jewish background in an effort to claim the high moral ground , there is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade away completely , as a people . Your advocacy of intermarriage for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that you hate the Jewish people . And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your own Jewishness on all Jews , you 've clearly demonstrated to me that you hate yourself . * * * * `` Who is a Jew ?

      "[CLS] I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( file is 5426dr13.zip ) . They 're very recent , I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS ( 570-226-2365 ) last night . If you are unable to get them there , email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well . I have a local bus based card ( VL24 Bitblaster from Micron ) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards ( or at least includes drivers for them ) . I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version , improving my graphic winmarks ( v3.11 ) by about 2 million ( 7.77 to 9.88 ) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus 's part but I do n't think so . From Steve Gibson 's ( [MASK] for Info World ) graphic card comparisons ( also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip ) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison : Wintach Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve 's system : 486/33 VLB : ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 9.33 10.34 20.78 8.28 14.90 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB : VL24 Bitblaster 9.88 8.65 11.71 18.84 15.40 13.65 Its no Viper , but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other [MASK] included in Gibson 's review .

      "[CLS] All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura . Otherwise , they are following a law put into effect by the Church , and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so . Andy Byler [ You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law . The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law , and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians . This argument is based on Paul 's letters , Acts , and in a more general [MASK] , Jesus ' teachings . Further , most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday , and Paul endorsing it . I understand that these points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more time . The point I 'm making here is not that these arguments are right , but that the backing they claim is Scripture . Accepting the principle of `` sola scriptura '' does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law . Acts 15 and Paul 's letters are quite clear on that . I think even the SDA 's accept it . The disagreement is on where the [MASK] would have us place the line . By the way , Protestants do give authority to the church , in matters that are not dictated by God . That 's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies , church polity , etc .

Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test -- even though some books [MASK] as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses . For example , the Lutheran hymn `` Now Thank We All Our God '' quotes a passage from this book . The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church 's history .

      "[CLS] hi all , IN SHORT : looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing on SVGA graphics . COMPLETE : I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones . ( ball-and-stick type ) Reasons : programs that I 've seen are far too slow for this purpose . Platform : 386/486 class machine . 800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics ( speed is important , 16-color for non-rendering purpose is enough ; may stay at 800x600 for speed reason . ) ( hope the code would be [MASK] enough for different SVGA cards . My own card is based on Trident 8900c , not VESA ? ) What I 'm looking for ? 1 ) fast , very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions . Presumably in assembly languagine . Yes , VERY [MASK] please . 2 ) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen . Drawings for beginning , would be lines , circles mainly , think of text , else later . ( you know , the way molecular graphics rotates , zooms a molecule ) 2 ) and any other codes ( preferentially in C ) that can help the project . Final remarks ; - non-profit . expected to become share- , free-ware . Any help is appreciated . thanks -Frankie lau @ tammy.harvard.edu [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Wrong about what ? I think they are correct in thinking that a well-placed bomb or six would get headlines , but I think they are wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a Buddhist . Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the Chinese occupiers . Every action is its own reward . On the other hand , people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it . And what does it cost us to admire them ? Zip . Yes they are , and whether this serves them well or not depends on whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence . And without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions ? The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists , just as the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements as terrorists . Better off in what way ? As proponents of pacifism or as proponents of political autonomy ? And better off in what time-scale ? The Soviet Empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities , some of which resisted violently , and [MASK] of which did not , but in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived . Now some of the minorities are fighting one another . Is that because they have to , or because violent [MASK] to an oppressive Empire legitimized violence ? [SEP]\n",

I agree that a name is a name is a name , and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans , then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea . If we can get people in the ( arena ) door by being uncomplicated , then let 's do so .

Also , is n't the point of `` professional '' hockey to make money for all those involved , which would include the players . What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due , and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult ( in the form of lesser recognition ) to injury ( less money than was deserved ) .

You do n't [MASK] have to believe in the `` religious '' aspects of Judaism to be a Jew ( this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity. ) . So , by converting out of Judaism , I do n't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism . I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation . I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage . ( I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my [MASK] of faith , but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate is n't it ? ) . The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation . We have no quotas ! So I will once again make my point . Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion ( not , as you say , religious belief ) is NOT racism . You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism . [SEP]\n",

A `` quick look '' does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah . Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life , I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies . Let me make one point . The clash between Jeremiah and the `` false prophets '' was primarily in the theological realm . The `` false prophets '' understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David . It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant , which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David 's descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power . Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet . He was from Anathoth , across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory . When he came to prophesy , he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses . The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the [MASK] of Solomon . His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets . It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies . The `` judgement prophesies '' were deeply loaded with theological meaning . In my opinion , both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson `` New York will burn '' prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah [MASK] . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - [SEP]\n",

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future , to the point of justifying development of such a thing . That 's a mighty fine idea . But since you asked `` Why not , '' I 'll respond . Putting aside the application of such a space dock , there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume . Temperature control is difficult in space , and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation ( maybe a double-walled inflatable ) . Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required . Do n't think this will be a [MASK] plastic bubble ; it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today . Because almost all manned space vessels ( Skylab , Mir , Salyut ) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity , even though they had ( have ) metal skins , they still kind of qualify as inflatable . The inflation process would [MASK] to be carefully controlled . The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials ( due to temperature extremes , monotomic Oxygen impingement , and radiation effects on materials ) , so your `` fabric '' may not retain any flexibility for long . ( This may not matter . ) Even after inflation , pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric , which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases . These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on ( it has been a couple of years since my [MASK] Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here ... ) Basic Scenario : I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of files on disk . The general setup is designed so that when [MASK] connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public key and the user 's public-private keypair is used to wrap the one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk . The result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the machine . What is possible is for someone to use the revealed system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal private keys during the authentication sequence . Questions : Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection as far as being coerced to reveal the key ? ( I doubt it myself.. ) It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am assisting in `` entrapment '' ( the users would send thier key anyway and are not being enticed into doing something they would not otherwise do ) but is there any other hook that can be used ? Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval ? Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated ... jim [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Was going over some videos last night ... .. Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting . And enlightening . Here 's my analysis of Jose Canseco , circa Sep '92 , and Jose Canseco , circa June 1986 . 1 . He 's bulked up too much . Period . He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds , not gain more bulk . 2 . His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED . Conservatively , I 'd say he 's lost 4 % -7 % of his bat speed , and that 's a HUGE amount of speed . 3 . That open stance is KILLING him . Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing - way open to start , then closes up as ball is [MASK] . Downing could do this without significant head movement - Canseco ca n't . Also , note that Canseco does n't always close his stance the same way - sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes , they 're fully closed . Without a good starting point , it 's hard to make adjustments in your swing . What would I do , if I were Jose ? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch , so that I 'd never have to work again , I 'd restructure my entire swing . First , minimize movement before the swing . Close and widen the stance , and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing . Hopefully , this will cut down on the time I need to swing , and will allow me to move the bathead more freely . Second , drop 20 pounds . Cut out the weight work . Third , relax the wrists . Will cost some power , but until I can find my 1988 stroke , concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up , rolling the wrists through the strike zone , and hit line drives . His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park . If Canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits [MASK] a result of his back problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years . If not , he could still hit 600+ HR . [SEP]\n",

Too much can block the external auditory canal ( the hole in the outside of the ear ) and cause some hearing problems . It is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your own , or at your physician 's office . You can take a syringe ( no needles ! ) and fill it with 50 % warm water ( [MASK] can cause fainting ) and 50 % OTC hydrogen peroxide . Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up ) and insert the tip of the syringe ( helps to have someone else do this ! ) and firmly expell the solution . Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax , this could take several rinses . If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water , it [MASK] be much drier : - ) . You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever you may have . If wax is old , it will be harder , and darker . You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax . Do this for a couple days , then try syringing again . It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse it out . Good Luck -heather [SEP]\n",

The responses I received are summerised below : Kevin Donnelly ( caoimhin @ smo.ac.uk ) mentioned that Michael Everson ( everson @ irlearn.ucd.ie ) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me . I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh , and that he will eventually port them to the PC , but that he will be charging IR 100 ( about $ 160 ) for each one . pbryant @ ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them ' . These are `` Durrow '' and `` American Uncial-Normal '' . I do n't know where you can get these but I do n't think that they have the effects I am looking for . Finally , rhiannon @ netcom.com ( Rhia ) mentioned that the `` Meath '' font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing . I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply . So that 's it . I 'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Gosh , I wish people would read the postings that they are 'following up ' to . The original poster ( W G Wright ) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple ( a Select 300 I think ) which can print GrayScale . He then said that he CAN NOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer ( and also that all the 'experts ' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible ) . This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade ( compared to Apple 's SE to SE/30 upgrade ) : you [MASK] never be able to run Color Quickdraw . It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale . SEs CAN print some COLOUR : this is because Quickdraw - the original , non-colour version , has the right hooks for eight colours . Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph ' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE ( I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something ) . There is no reason that Apple could n't release software patches for older computers ( there are lots of Mac Pluses , Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw ) - but they wont , and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac 's ROMs ( i.e . Nutek et al. ) . Just one Caveat : I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer , that you would be able to do so , whatever Mac you were using . ( And I am [MASK] sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [ ? correct me if I 'm wrong ? ] ) . [SEP]\n",

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God . I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus . If anything , [MASK] clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended . If you 'll notice , He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations . They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts . That is why He points out that our [MASK] must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven . People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin . They had become legalistic , rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it . I think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it . What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart ? Christianity is not just a set of rules ; it 's a lifestyle that changes one 's perspectives and personal conduct . And it demands obedience to God 's will . Some people can live by it , but many others can not or will not . That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too .

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ ( Pub . Harper and Row , 1988 ) . The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb . Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection . Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg 's work _Resurrection , Immortality , and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ ( Publ Cambridge , Havard Univ . Press , 1972 ) is most helpful . Look At Rom 1:1-3 . Paul here has no need of an empty tomb . Additionally in 1 Cor 15 , Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb . He was raised ( note the passive ) , he appeared , no ascension either . Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave . The whole idea of an empty tomb is n't broached in any of our [MASK] until well after the fall of Jerusalem . By that time , the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious . Moreover Mack has argued ( convicingly , I [MASK] ) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark ( we have no texts before this which mention the tomb ) . You are quite right here . Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable . See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_ . [SEP]\n",

There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller . One with 9 wires and another with 34 wires . The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and [MASK] for a 34 wire bus . Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine , and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller ( there is room for a 9 wire-bus , but not for the 34 wire bus ) How can I solve my problem , any suggestions ? If you need more info , mail me , please ( luttik @ fwi.uva.nl ) . [SEP]\n",

I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter .

The problem is that my top level frame created as frame = ( Frame ) xv_create ( NULL , FRAME , NULL ) ; seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas . I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits . I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info ; int depth = 24 ; Colormap colormap ; XSetWindowAttributes attribs ; unsigned long valuemask = 0 ; Window *win ; Xv_opaque frame ; win = xv_get ( frame , XV_XID ) ; XMatchVisualInfo ( display , screen , depth , TrueColor , & visual_info ) ; /* [MASK] far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap ( display , win , visual_info , AllocNone ) ; /* It dies here with a BadMatch error : ( */ attribs.colormap = colormap ; valuemask |= CWColormap ; XChangeWindowAttributes ( display , w , valuemask , & attribs ) ; XSetWindowColormap ( display , win , colormap ) ; Am I using a completely wrong approach here ?

However , I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an `` incredibly perverse '' interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse .

      "[CLS] Many pagans are involved in environmentalism -- this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations . This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it . Nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity . Like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should [MASK] , and is n't . I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten . This does n't mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . First , paganism respects the feminine . Christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many ( if not most ) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner . The idea that God is sexless , or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . This insistance on a male-dominated theology ( and the male-dominated society that goes with it ) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . Second , paganism respects the physical world . This is an idea with great ramifications . One of these is environmentalism -- respect for our surroundings and our world . Another is integration of sexuality . Christianity has a long tradition of calling [MASK] sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . This is too much -- sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) should be changed -- just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to God . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years , thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians . In retrospect , I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many . I originally saw it just as poetic license , but it 's understandable that others might see it differently . I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though . I also think that your advice to Masud [MASK] : # Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee , it 's a good idea to # do a little homework , or at least think . was unnecessary . Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the [MASK] assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism . If I agreed with that , then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant . But I think you 're reading a lot into one flip sentence . While probably not true in this case , too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel . Anyway , I 'd rather be somewhere else , so I 'm outta this thread . [SEP]\n",

I do n't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate , but I do think it 's worth pointing out that `` popular usage '' is not always sufficient excuse . In this case , for example , I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names : if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it ? Probably not . The same is true of X . `` The X Window System '' , `` X '' , `` X11 '' , and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name . In fact , some of them are *trademarked* names . The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point . As for the trade publications that promulgate things like `` X [MASK] '' or `` X.windows '' or any of the other nonsensical [MASK] one often sees , consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists* . Would you trust the facts of a journalist who could n't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right ? Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong ?

A secret algorithm can still be secure , after all , we just do n't know it . Only our level of trust is affected , not the security of the system . The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know , which we believe to be secure . They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security . They want to protect its market share . If they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow . And of course , everybody would buy them . The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules , they get us to follow their [MASK] without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail . Quite simply , with Clipper established , it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that ca n't talk to the leading phone companies . The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 % of the populace . To get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system , and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one . That 's the chicken and egg of crypto . The government is using its [MASK] special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like .

      "[CLS] I think this is a weak argument . The fact is , there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_ , one of which has unquestionably at least [MASK] altered by Christians . Origen wrote , in the third century , that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah , while the long passage says the opposite . There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic . There is no question that Origen , in the third century , saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus . There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references . It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted , but I do n't think it 's very likely -- nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case . ( I know G.A . Wells takes this position , but that 's because he takes the very [MASK] minority view that Jesus never existed . And he is a professor of German , not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus . ) [SEP]\n",

When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions , nothing happened . I tried it with another keyboard , using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard . The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise . I checked the dipswitches and they are fine . Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works . I am annoyed with Datadesk . I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement . The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time . Well , they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it . It 's annoying because it cost me $ 12 to send them the keyboard ( they do not refund the money ) and their costumer service lines are toll calls .

      "[CLS] Hi . I 'm not sure what the other guy ( ca n't track down his post for his name ) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable . They [MASK] . There 's a [MASK] between each link where the `` teeth '' of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is a possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks `` LOOK '' a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional . Finally , I notice that when I ride with my leathers , harness boots , and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier ( BTW , I 've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock did n't pulverize any vertebrae ) , cagers give me a much wider berth , do n't hassle me , and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights . I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80 's Honda dinosaur . ( I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on ( i.e. , on my body ) and I can feel the bike already shaking away ) . My first post . What did I do wrong : ) ? sang DoD # 0846 '80 CX500 p.s . any other CX500 owners out there ? Please e-mail me . Got questions about the weird handling on my bike . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Yes , absolutely , though I 'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases . But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back , once again , to equating the business of science with the end result , the gizmo produced . My point is n't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* you come about developing it . Perhaps you 'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part ( the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them , I 'm making them too ) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science . Biomedical research does n't make any basic assumptions that are n't the same as any other discipline of scientific research . That is , that you make empirical observations , form an hypothesis and test it . Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than `` the old Newtonian model of the world '' . And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical `` world view '' . Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending . Oversimplified , of course , but a good example . This is an empirical observa- tion . It was then tested , though perhaps not by Aristotle , and eventually found wanting . In the meantime , some [MASK] will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life . There 's nothing [MASK] all surprising about this , it 's the way the gathering of knowledge works . There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base , even idiotic , to someone in the future . These future people wo n't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip . Someone will have thought of something new and tested it . This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research ca n't seem to wrap their minds around . Science is a creative process .

      "[CLS] : : I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with : the extended cab . Any opinions about these vehicles ? Have there been : any significant problems ? : : -- : Dick Grady Salem , NH , USA grady @ world.std.com : So many newsgroups , so little time ! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is `` a characteristic of the transmission . '' Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to [MASK] 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD ( 8600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for `` engine longevity '' reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a [MASK] individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ . . . ] I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of `` right '' and `` wrong '' ( or `` correct/incorrect '' or `` true/false '' ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is `` right '' ( correct , true , veridical ) or `` wrong '' ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question [MASK] motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply ca n't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it [MASK] double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the `` rightness '' of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one can not feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the `` correctness '' of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) .

When I obtained my second motorcycle , I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike . I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle . For about the same money ( $ 20 ) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock ( advantages : lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both , Kryptonite name ) or a cheesy no-name U-lock ( advantages : real steel ) . I chose the Kryptonite cable . After less than a week , I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock . First , the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite , is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee , and does n't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance . It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it . Secondly , the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke . I do n't know if mine was a particularly poor example , but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage , and sometimes it would seem to engage , only to fall open when I went to unlock it . Thirdly , the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole [MASK] of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark . I did n't try it ( obviously ) , but I have my doubts that the [MASK] mechanism would stand up to an `` insert screwdriver and TORQUE '' attack . Fourthly , the cable was not , in my opinion , of sufficient thickness to deter theft ( for my piece of crap bicycle , that is ) .

      "[CLS] completed Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon ? If you are trying to write a game , you should n't be using SndPlay . Instead , make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it . It works great . You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty . Before it gets empty . 7.1 , Callbacks are very reliable , I found them 100 % reliable , even under System 4.1 . I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation . You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels , of course you did n't get called . In general , if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel ( with the related slowdown ) , but then when you play more than one you do n't work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel , possibly the same one multiple times . This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays . Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them . You need to resedit the sound and remove that command , then when you create your [MASK] , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth . Then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want . You 'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd 's , since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks . Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it , and the sound manager does n't work for games , remember , Spectre uses it . And it works great . If Spectre can spare the CPU time , you can too . One little disclaimer : There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi ca n't be made to work right . I 'm not sure either way , but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100 % correctly on every [MASK] machine using the Sound Manager . [SEP]\n",

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree ' measurement ( that the temperature is in Centigrade , rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit ) , you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions : 1 . You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually , the melting point of most iron alloys ( and steels are iron alloys ) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C. Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature , the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed , and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon . 2 . A fire is not an isothermal [MASK] . There are 'hot ' spots and 'cold ' spots , though 'cold ' is purely a relative term .

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling ( in the 70s and 50s , respectively ) . It 's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds ( KC-135 and YF-102 ) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement . The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us . The Air Force , of course , was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts . Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s . No mechnaical or analog backup , to show you how confident we were . General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were . ( Mind you , the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier , but analog . ) Phil > Egad ! I 'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer ! The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing . On the other hand , all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings -- something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base ca n't do . [SEP]\n",

Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver , and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode . - Unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers ( i.e. , either assert high or assert low ) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers ( assert high , assert low , or [MASK] n't assert anything ) . The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper .

      "[CLS] Well , there *is* a difference . I do n't happen to have my SAE manual handy , but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature . The SAE numbers are based on a ` typical ' curve that oils used to all [MASK] , running from ( say ) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C , down to ( say ) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C , for a typical 40-weight oil . Oils that are designed for operation in ` normal ' temperatures just have a weight specification . Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a ` W ' tacked on the end , so in winter in a cold place , you 'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in [MASK] in the summer , to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year . Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature . As a result , their viscosity graphs cross over several curves . A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures , a ` normal ' operating temperature and a ` cold ' one ( though I ca n't remember the numbers ... ) . In any event , the weights do indicate a significant difference . Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated ( by the thermostat and radiator or air fins ) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something . Any weight of oil is better than no oil , or than very old , carbonized oil . Thin oil wo n't ( in general ) lubricate as well at temperature , thicker oil will ( like a 20W50 ) will lubricate better at temperature , but not as well during startup , when most engine wear occurs . If you 're planning on making long drives , the 20W50 is probably fine ( esp . in the summer ) in your 10W40 car . But if you 're making short drives , stick to the 10W40 . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] `` Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible '' Today ( 4/6 ) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above . The article starts with `` A [MASK] of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible . '' O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research `` is a real question for me . '' O'Connor said `` everything is fair game , '' including `` dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry , chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country , working closely with the Russian space station Mir , and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned [MASK] shuttle fleet . '' O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far , and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost . The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option ( I believe Kathy Sawyer , the Post writer , got confused here . I listened in on part of O'Connor 's briefing to the press on Monday , and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options , sorted by cost [ low , medium , and high ] . In another part of the briefing , he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ SSF derivative @ LaRC , modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC , and Single Launch Core [ `` wingless Orbiter '' ] @ JSC . Later , in response to a reporters question , I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a `` moderate '' cost option , in between low & high cost options . Not the `` high cost '' option as Sawyer wrote ) . The article goes on to describe the other two options as `` one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit , similar to the Russian Mir . The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch , like Skylab . That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage , for example , in its basic structure . '' [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] May 13 , 1993 _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW ( UPI ) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia 's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly `` carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers . '' A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said `` the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , '' the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported . But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment . `` This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , '' the statement reads . The five men , together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence , were captured in September 1992 [MASK] Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan , between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan , after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops . However , the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh . Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . Both [MASK] and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union , are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war . The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the Russian authorities . It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey . Itar-tass said that the soldiers ' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency . [SEP]\n",

People die for lies all the time . Was Hitler a liar ? How about Napoleon , Mussolini , Ronald Reagan ? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying ?

Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics ? How about Genghis Khan , Jim Jones ... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics . So we obviously can not rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad . Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy ( ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies ) , possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general ; public had access . possibly also that the text is written in such riddles ( like Nostradamus ) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional 'prophecy ' .

      "[CLS] The law is much worse than worthless . It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they ( the police ) find something they do n't understand . Most police do n't know what the return key does , never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets . There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either . It could be uninitialized junk . The burden of proof is on the user to show that it 's something a normal upstanding citizen should have . No one should ever be put in that situation , especially in America . What 's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it , to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer , or [MASK] bad thing is in style at the time . Basically most people do n't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects . As an analogy , it 's like they find a loose screw in your house , and they insist that you 're [MASK] a bomb or machine gun . They ask you where it came from ( like you 'd know ) , and ask you to prove your claim . When you explain it in such simple terms , people may start to get the idea . As a matter of fact , i do keep random files on my disk . The reason is , without special-purpose hardware , it takes a long time to generate good random bits . I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute , which is pretty conservative , but over time that 's more than i need . If you think about it , there 's no point in actually encrypting random data , because it just gives you different random data . If you want some data to look like an encrypted file , you just put an appropriate header on it . If enough people do this , some of them will be put in jail . When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys , you can tell them it 's just random junk , although of course they wo n't believe you . While you 're sitting in jail , you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that 's not there . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools ( v7.1 ) compress ? I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than PC-Cache running , so that is not it . The first time I try to run Ami Pro after loading windows , it loads , but causes ( I think it was a ) segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes , with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading , and then causes a general protection fault in module AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147 . I have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling Ami Pro . This has happened twice , with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive . BTW , I am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs , and if you do n't already know , PCTools compress is actually a defragger , despite it 's name . My system [MASK] a 386-40MHz , with 16MB of RAM and a NEC ( OEM ) hard drive , etc , but that should n't make a difference . PLEASE email me as I ca n't keep [MASK] with the newsgroup , and it will cut down on net traffic anyways . Thanks . -Derek [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ Deletions ] Geez , Dal must have slipped something into Ted 's drink sometime . Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable . Prince has never hit well in the minors and he 's now 27 years old , I think . Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors . ( I 'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I do n't have another brain cramp and forget . ) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors . As I recall , the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit , decent fielding . When he got to the majors and did n't hit as well as expected ( not as much playing time ? ) , he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols ' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher . It 's not clear he ever learned to hit . His four years with more than 100 AB -- Born 31 July 1962 Year AB BA SLG OBA 1988 195 .282 .320 .328 1990 220 .277 .373 .321 1991 459 .264 .351 .317 1992 485 .249 .359 .290 No power , less-than-league-average walks , [MASK] year when he turned 28 , now declining . If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince , given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors , it 's not a rosy picture . BTW , I 'm still unhappy with moving Zeile , [MASK] had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi , except that he was a much , much better hitter , to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average ( or below average ) fielding catcher .

My daughter 's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics . This week they sent something *very* interesting . It was an article written by the leader of a national ( US ) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem . While there , he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem . The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible . What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building . The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building . Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque , making [MASK] impossible without sparking a holy war .

( Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident ( right bloody in front of me ) , and was unable to save the life of one of the participants , as I reported here . ) Also , drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death , which raises the insurance rates , forces stupidly restrictive laws , and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly . In my view , drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence . It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue , but a genuine safety issue .

      "[CLS] Well , almost . It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the Earth 's gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite , and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years . My favorite [MASK] of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class , which are in 14:1 resonance . In particular , C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in altitude , the current one having started in June 1991 ; the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 March 1987 .

      "[CLS] Hello , Let me introduce a problem : When I measure a sinusoidal wave ( voltage ) with a digital voltmeter , using AC mode , my output is an rms value ( a peak value over 2 squared ) . / Right ? / When I measure a square wave in the same mode ( AC ) , my output is equal to a peak [MASK] , actually , to the upper flat boundary of the wave . I assumed , that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value , and divides it over the wave period . / Right ? / Now , I used it to measure the same square wave as above , but distorted by high-frequency harmonics . Ideally , output should be the same , but ... The output value was only about 10 % of the previous one ! Why ? What is the nature of this output value ? What does the voltmeter actually measure ? And what does it show ? Related question ( less important to me ) : What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones ?

      "[CLS] Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems : 1 ) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM , which is what I have . This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01 . A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM . 2 ) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations : a ) Under NDW , when an entry in a list is highlighted ( such as in an Open menu ) and then is deselected , a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be . b ) With Word for Windows , when you use shading in a table , the display shows the [MASK] of the shading ; for example , if you shade the cell as 10 % , the display is 90 % ( the printout is OK ) . 3 ) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment . The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon ( or use the Debugger option in the Run command ) , and the [MASK] application goes to VGA character mode ( as it is designed to do ) . The screen goes haywire , and is largely unreadable . The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled . Through trial and error , I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [ Alt-Spacebar ] followed by the letter `` R '' . This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen , and it does this satisfactorily . I wish I did n't have to do this . The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers . The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows . There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode . The problem is not my monitor . The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one . I still like this video card , and am hoping its problems will be remedied ( they do offer a 5 year warranty ) . [SEP]\n",

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision . More than that would seem to be wasted . Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding . Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit ( 8 bits per component ) frame buffers . This set up , [MASK] double buffering , allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer ( containing the [MASK] frame ) is displayed .

When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA ( an essentially FA ) in reducing inflammation . The evidence was mixed . [ Many of these studies are discussed in `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease , '' MacDermott , Stenson . 1992 . ] But if I recall correctly , there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies ( both the ones w/pos . and w/neg . results ) . In the studies patients were given EPA ( a few grams/day for most of the studies ) , but , if I recall correctly , there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume . From the [MASK] layperson 's perspective , this seems mistaken . If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA , then the ratio of `` bad '' prostanoid products to `` good '' prostanoid products could still be fairly `` bad . '' Is n't this ratio the issue ? What 's the view of the gastro . community on EPA these days ?

They speak for themselves . ED > ED > best regards from a Palestinian of Jewish origin who talks , reads and writes ED > Hebrew and does not hate Jews nor anybody else . ED > ED > Elias The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite true . The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in this group . Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel , and Jewish identity in general , reveal biases that indicate a great steaming heap of hatred ! You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for objectivity . You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from their original [MASK] so that they can be used to further an agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel . You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image of several Israeli leaders . I ca n't say if you actually HATE these leaders , but the lies and misrepresentations of them do suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them . So , while you claim that you do not hate anybody , there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false . It is obvious that you hate Israel , and it is evident that you hate the Jewish people . And , if you are Jewish , you are a self-hating Jew . There can [MASK] no doubt of this . Although you will call upon your Jewish background in an effort to claim the high moral ground , there is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade away completely , as a people . Your advocacy of intermarriage for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that you hate the Jewish people . And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your own Jewishness on all Jews , you 've clearly demonstrated to me that you hate yourself . * * * * `` Who is a Jew ? A person whose integrity decays when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong done to other people . '' [SEP]\n",

They 're very recent , I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS ( 570-226-2365 ) last night . If you are unable to get them there , email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well . I have a local bus based card ( VL24 Bitblaster from Micron ) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards ( or at least includes drivers for them ) . I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version , improving my graphic winmarks ( v3.11 ) by about 2 million ( 7.77 to 9.88 ) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus 's part but I do n't think so . From Steve Gibson 's ( [MASK] for Info World ) graphic card comparisons ( also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip ) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison : Wintach Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve 's system : 486/33 VLB : ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 9.33 10.34 20.78 8.28 14.90 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB : VL24 Bitblaster 9.88 8.65 11.71 18.84 15.40 13.65 Its no Viper , but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other [MASK] included in Gibson 's review .

      "[CLS] All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura . Otherwise , they are following a law put into effect by the Church , and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so . Andy Byler [ You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law . The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law , and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians . This argument is based on Paul 's letters , Acts , and in a more general [MASK] , Jesus ' teachings . Further , most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday , and Paul endorsing it . I understand that these points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more time . The point I 'm making here is not that these arguments are right , but that the backing they claim is Scripture . Accepting the principle of `` sola scriptura '' does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law . Acts 15 and Paul 's letters are quite clear on that . I think even the SDA 's accept it . The disagreement is on where the [MASK] would have us place the line . By the way , Protestants do give authority to the church , in matters that are not dictated by God .

Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test -- even though some books [MASK] as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses . For example , the Lutheran hymn `` Now Thank We All Our God '' quotes a passage from this book . The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church 's history .

      "[CLS] hi all , IN SHORT : looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing on SVGA graphics . COMPLETE : I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones . ( ball-and-stick type ) Reasons : programs that I 've seen are far too slow for this purpose . Platform : 386/486 class machine . 800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics ( speed is important , 16-color for non-rendering purpose is enough ; may stay at 800x600 for speed reason . ) ( hope the code would be [MASK] enough for different SVGA cards .

I think they are correct in thinking that a well-placed bomb or six would get headlines , but I think they are wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a Buddhist . Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the Chinese occupiers . Every action is its own reward . On the other hand , people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it . And what does it cost us to admire them ? Zip . Yes they are , and whether this serves them well or not depends on whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence . And without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions ? The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists , just as the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements as terrorists . Better off in what way ? As proponents of pacifism or as proponents of political autonomy ? And better off in what time-scale ? The Soviet Empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities , some of which resisted violently , and [MASK] of which did not , but in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived .

A `` quick look '' does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah . Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life , I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies . Let me make one point . The clash between Jeremiah and the `` false prophets '' was primarily in the theological realm . The `` false prophets '' understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David . It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant , which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David 's descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power . Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet . He was from Anathoth , across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory . When he came to prophesy , he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses . The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the [MASK] of Solomon . His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets . It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies . The `` judgement prophesies '' were deeply loaded with theological meaning . In my opinion , both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson `` New York will burn '' prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah [MASK] . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - [SEP]\n",

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future , to the point of justifying development of such a thing . That 's a mighty fine idea . But since you asked `` Why not , '' I 'll respond . Putting aside the application of such a space dock , there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume . Temperature control is difficult in space , and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation ( maybe a double-walled inflatable ) . Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required . Do n't think this will be a [MASK] plastic bubble ; it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today . Because almost all manned space vessels ( Skylab , Mir , Salyut ) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity , even though they had ( have ) metal skins , they still kind of qualify as inflatable . The inflation process would [MASK] to be carefully controlled . The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials ( due to temperature extremes , monotomic Oxygen impingement , and radiation effects on materials ) , so your `` fabric '' may not retain any flexibility for long . ( This may not matter . ) Even after inflation , pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric , which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases . These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 [SEP]\n",

The only problem is these Indiana winters -- my heater controls do n't work . The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents . Right now it is stuck in the `` vent '' mode . It will blow warm air , but I ca n't switch the air flow to either the floor ( I can live without this ) or the defrost ( I ca n't live without this ) .

      "[CLS] I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on ( it has been a couple of years since my [MASK] Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here ... ) Basic Scenario : I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of files on disk . The general setup is designed so that when [MASK] connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public key and the user 's public-private keypair is used to wrap the one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk . The result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the machine . What is possible is for someone to use the revealed system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal private keys during the authentication sequence . Questions : Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection as far as being coerced to reveal the key ? ( I doubt it myself.. ) It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am assisting in `` entrapment '' ( the users would send thier key anyway and are not being enticed into doing something they would not otherwise do ) but is there any other hook that can be used ? Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval ? Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated ... jim [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Was going over some videos last night ... .. Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting . And enlightening . Here 's my analysis of Jose Canseco , circa Sep '92 , and Jose Canseco , circa June 1986 . 1 . He 's bulked up too much . Period . He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds , not gain more bulk . 2 . His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED . Conservatively , I 'd say he 's lost 4 % -7 % of his bat speed , and that 's a HUGE amount of speed . 3 . That open stance is KILLING him . Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing - way open to start , then closes up as ball is [MASK] . Downing could do this without significant head movement - Canseco ca n't . Also , note that Canseco does n't always close his stance the same way - sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes , they 're fully closed . Without a good starting point , it 's hard to make adjustments in your swing . What would I do , if I were Jose ? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch , so that I 'd never have to work again , I 'd restructure my entire swing . First , minimize movement before the swing . Close and widen the stance , and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing . Hopefully , this will cut down on the time I need to swing , and will allow me to move the bathead more freely . Second , drop 20 pounds . Cut out the weight work . Third , relax the wrists . Will cost some power , but until I can find my 1988 stroke , concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up , rolling the wrists through the strike zone , and hit line drives . His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park . If Canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits [MASK] a result of his back problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years . If not , he could still hit 600+ HR . [SEP]\n",

Too much can block the external auditory canal ( the hole in the outside of the ear ) and cause some hearing problems . It is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your own , or at your physician 's office . You can take a syringe ( no needles ! ) and fill it with 50 % warm water ( [MASK] can cause fainting ) and 50 % OTC hydrogen peroxide . Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up ) and insert the tip of the syringe ( helps to have someone else do this ! ) and firmly expell the solution .

You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever you may have . If wax is old , it will be harder , and darker . You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax . Do this for a couple days , then try syringing again . It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse it out . Good Luck -heather [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] RE : Irish/Gaelic TrueType Font wanted - synopsis Many thanks to those who responded to my question . Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested in geting one , and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting that description . This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of Dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the early part of the century . This may take me some time to do ( in my limited spare time ) but I 'll [MASK] [MASK] available to anyone who is interested , when it is ready . The responses I received are summerised below : Kevin Donnelly ( caoimhin @ smo.ac.uk ) mentioned that Michael Everson ( everson @ irlearn.ucd.ie ) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me . I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh , and that he will eventually port them to the PC , but that he will be charging IR 100 ( about $ 160 ) for each one . pbryant @ ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them ' . These are `` Durrow '' and `` American Uncial-Normal '' . I do n't know where you can get these but I do n't think that they have the effects I am looking for . Finally , rhiannon @ netcom.com ( Rhia ) mentioned that the `` Meath '' font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing . I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply . So that 's it . I 'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available . [SEP]\n",

The original poster ( W G Wright ) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple ( a Select 300 I think ) which can print GrayScale . He then said that he CAN NOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer ( and also that all the 'experts ' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible ) . This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade ( compared to Apple 's SE to SE/30 upgrade ) : you [MASK] never be able to run Color Quickdraw . It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale . SEs CAN print some COLOUR : this is because Quickdraw - the original , non-colour version , has the right hooks for eight colours . Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph ' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE ( I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something ) . There is no reason that Apple could n't release software patches for older computers ( there are lots of Mac Pluses , Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw ) - but they wont , and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac 's ROMs ( i.e . Nutek et al. ) . Just one Caveat : I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer , that you would be able to do so , whatever Mac you were using . ( And I am [MASK] sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [ ? correct me if I 'm wrong ? ] ) . [SEP]\n",

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God . I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus . If anything , [MASK] clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended . If you 'll notice , He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations . They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts . That is why He points out that our [MASK] must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven . People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin .

I think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it . What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart ? Christianity is not just a set of rules ; it 's a lifestyle that changes one 's perspectives and personal conduct . And it demands obedience to God 's will . Some people can live by it , but many others can not or will not . That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too .

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ ( Pub . Harper and Row , 1988 ) . The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb . Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection . Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg 's work _Resurrection , Immortality , and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ ( Publ Cambridge , Havard Univ . Press , 1972 ) is most helpful . Look At Rom 1:1-3 . Paul here has no need of an empty tomb . Additionally in 1 Cor 15 , Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb . He was raised ( note the passive ) , he appeared , no ascension either . Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave . The whole idea of an empty tomb is n't broached in any of our [MASK] until well after the fall of Jerusalem . By that time , the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious . Moreover Mack has argued ( convicingly , I [MASK] ) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark ( we have no texts before this which mention the tomb ) . You are quite right here . Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable . See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_ . [SEP]\n",

It mentioned that it included software to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk . As someone who has SIMMS he ca n't get rid of/use , but hates the waste , this sounds to me like a majorly good idea . Does anyone out there know what board/company I 'm talking about ? Are they still in business , or does anyone know where I can get a used one if they are no longer made ? Any help would be greatly appreciated . [MASK] e-mail me , to save net.bandwidth . Thanks , Cap . [SEP]\n",

Cap Cities are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up base [MASK] for a launch for any brand new cable service . The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks . Prime SportsChannel will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season . Also , TCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers . TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully . And the NHL 's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN . NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams . [SEP]\n",

I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter .

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits . I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info ; int depth = 24 ; Colormap colormap ; XSetWindowAttributes attribs ; unsigned long valuemask = 0 ; Window *win ; Xv_opaque frame ; win = xv_get ( frame , XV_XID ) ; XMatchVisualInfo ( display , screen , depth , TrueColor , & visual_info ) ; /* [MASK] far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap ( display , win , visual_info , AllocNone ) ; /* It dies here with a BadMatch error : ( */ attribs.colormap = colormap ; valuemask |= CWColormap ; XChangeWindowAttributes ( display , w , valuemask , & attribs ) ; XSetWindowColormap ( display , win , colormap ) ; Am I using a completely wrong approach here ?

      "[CLS] whitsebd @ nextwork.rose-hulman.edu ( Bryan Whitsell ) sent in a list of verses which he felt condemn homosexuality . mls @ panix.com ( Michael Siemon ) wrote in response that some of these verses `` are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations '' and that others `` simply do not address the issues . '' [ remainder of my post deleted ] The moderator then made some comments I would like to address : If you are referring to the terms `` effeminate '' and `` homosexuals '' in the above passage , I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged . However , I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an `` incredibly perverse '' interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse . Therefore I do not believe it is `` incredibly perverse '' to read it in this way . Actually , I was n't thinking of the church at all . After all , a couple does n't have to be married by a minister . A secular justice of the peace could do the job , and the two people would be married . My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage , but where in the Bible would [MASK] get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex ? And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages , how willing would gay Christians be to `` save themselves '' for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship ? Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be [MASK] to be so monogamous , I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject . I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual , yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position . So what is the gay view ? - Mark [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Many pagans are involved in environmentalism -- this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations . This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it . Nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity . Like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should [MASK] , and is n't . I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten . This does n't mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . First , paganism respects the feminine . Christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many ( if not most ) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner . The idea that God is sexless , or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . This insistance on a male-dominated theology ( and the male-dominated society that goes with it ) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . Second , paganism respects the physical world . This is an idea with great ramifications . One of these is environmentalism -- respect for our surroundings and our world . Another is integration of sexuality . Christianity has a long tradition of calling [MASK] sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . This is too much -- sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) should be changed -- just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to God . [SEP]\n",

GL stands for Grasp Library . There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ . There are freely distributable viewers for GL files , and they are usually named GRASPRT ? .EXE ( replace the ? with a version digit or letter ) . Most GL files [MASK] frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes of the CGA , EGA , or VGA adapters on PCs . I think that there are some copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp ( I know that I got one there a long time ago ) . Good Luck Jack [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years , thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians . In retrospect , I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many . I originally saw it just as poetic license , but it 's understandable that others might see it differently . I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though . I also think that your advice to Masud [MASK] : # Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee , it 's a good idea to # do a little homework , or at least think . was unnecessary . Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the [MASK] assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism . If I agreed with that , then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant . But I think you 're reading a lot into one flip sentence . While probably not true in this case , too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel . Anyway , I 'd rather be somewhere else , so I 'm outta this thread . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Well , yes and no . I do n't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate , but I do think it 's worth pointing out that `` popular usage '' is not always sufficient excuse . In this case , for example , I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names : if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it ? Probably not . The same is true of X . `` The X Window System '' , `` X '' , `` X11 '' , and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name . In fact , some of them are *trademarked* names . The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point . As for the trade publications that promulgate things like `` X [MASK] '' or `` X.windows '' or any of the other nonsensical [MASK] one often sees , consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists* . Would you trust the facts of a journalist who could n't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right ? Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong ? Popular usage is as it may be , but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness . [SEP]\n",

A secret algorithm can still be secure , after all , we just do n't know it . Only our level of trust is affected , not the security of the system . The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know , which we believe to be secure . They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security . They want to protect its market share . If they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow . And of course , everybody would buy them . The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules , they get us to follow their [MASK] without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail . Quite simply , with Clipper established , it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that ca n't talk to the leading phone companies . The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 % of the populace . To get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system , and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one . That 's the chicken and egg of crypto . The government is using its [MASK] special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like .

      "[CLS] Hi , I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.1 .

With xdm , the .login file does n't get executed and [MASK] neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables . I used the `` DisplayManager._0.userPath '' resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable . But I am having problems passing anything else ! ! ! I tried execing $ HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession [MASK] that did n't help . I also tried using '' DisplayManager.exportList : HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH '' which did n't work either . I would appreciate any help on this matter . Thanks in advance , Shash [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think this is a weak argument . The fact is , there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_ , one of which has unquestionably at least [MASK] altered by Christians . Origen wrote , in the third century , that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah , while the long passage says the opposite . There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic . There is no question that Origen , in the third century , saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus . There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references . It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted , but I do n't think it 's very likely -- nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case . ( I know G.A . Wells takes this position , but that 's because he takes the very [MASK] minority view that Jesus never existed . And he is a professor of German , not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus . ) [SEP]\n",

When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions , nothing happened . I tried it with another keyboard , using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard .

I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement . The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time . Well , they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it . It 's annoying because it cost me $ 12 to send them the keyboard ( they do not refund the money ) and their costumer service lines are toll calls .

      "[CLS] Hi . I 'm not sure what the other guy ( ca n't track down his post for his name ) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable . They [MASK] . There 's a [MASK] between each link where the `` teeth '' of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is a possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks `` LOOK '' a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional . Finally , I notice that when I ride with my leathers , harness boots , and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier ( BTW , I 've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock did n't pulverize any vertebrae ) , cagers give me a much wider berth , do n't hassle me , and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights . I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80 's Honda dinosaur . ( I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on ( i.e. , on my body ) and I can feel the bike already shaking away ) . My first post .

But there are two , that I saw live that would [MASK] to be up there ( up where ? there ! ) . 1 ) Rick Monday 's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981 . It was hit off Steve Rogers , who is a RHP and primarily a starter . Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen . Considering Monday could n't touch LHP , Lee would have been a safe bet . He [MASK] n't even doing any drugs at that time ( or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into Montreal . The blast was n't the important aspect . It was the timing . Seventh game , a tie game , and in the top of the 9th . The Expos almost came back though ... 2 ) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980 . So close , yet , so far . and 3 ) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago . It went off the technical ring in the Big O . It almost left the stadium ! That was hit HARD ! ! ! CorelMARK ! [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Yes , absolutely , though I 'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases . But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back , once again , to equating the business of science with the end result , the gizmo produced . My point is n't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* you come about developing it . Perhaps you 'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part ( the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them , I 'm making them too ) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science . Biomedical research does n't make any basic assumptions that are n't the same as any other discipline of scientific research . That is , that you make empirical observations , form an hypothesis and test it . Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than `` the old Newtonian model of the world '' . And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical `` world view '' . Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending . Oversimplified , of course , but a good example . This is an empirical observa- tion . It was then tested , though perhaps not by Aristotle , and eventually found wanting . In the meantime , some [MASK] will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life . There 's nothing [MASK] all surprising about this , it 's the way the gathering of knowledge works . There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base , even idiotic , to someone in the future . These future people wo n't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip . Someone will have thought of something new and tested it . This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research ca n't seem to wrap their minds around . Science is a creative process . What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories . [SEP]\n",

Have there been : any significant problems ? : : -- : Dick Grady Salem , NH , USA grady @ world.std.com : So many newsgroups , so little time ! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is `` a characteristic of the transmission . '' Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to [MASK] 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD ( 8600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for `` engine longevity '' reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a [MASK] individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ . . . ] I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of `` right '' and `` wrong '' ( or `` correct/incorrect '' or `` true/false '' ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is `` right '' ( correct , true , veridical ) or `` wrong '' ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question [MASK] motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply ca n't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it [MASK] double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the `` rightness '' of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one can not feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the `` correctness '' of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) .

      "[CLS] A word of warning , though : Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name . When I obtained my second motorcycle , I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike . I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle . For about the same money ( $ 20 ) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock ( advantages : lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both , Kryptonite name ) or a cheesy no-name U-lock ( advantages : real steel ) . I chose the Kryptonite cable . After less than a week , I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock . First , the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite , is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee , and does n't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance . It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it . Secondly , the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke . I do n't know if mine was a particularly poor example , but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage , and sometimes it would seem to engage , only to fall open when I went to unlock it . Thirdly , the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole [MASK] of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark . I did n't try it ( obviously ) , but I have my doubts that the [MASK] mechanism would stand up to an `` insert screwdriver and TORQUE '' attack . Fourthly , the cable was not , in my opinion , of sufficient thickness to deter theft ( for my piece of crap bicycle , that is ) . All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time . If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers .

      "[CLS] completed Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon ? If you are trying to write a game , you should n't be using SndPlay . Instead , make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it . It works great . You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty . Before it gets empty . 7.1 , Callbacks are very reliable , I found them 100 % reliable , even under System 4.1 . I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation . You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels , of course you did n't get called . In general , if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel ( with the related slowdown ) , but then when you play more than one you do n't work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel , possibly the same one multiple times . This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays . Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them . You need to resedit the sound and remove that command , then when you create your [MASK] , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth . Then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want . You 'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd 's , since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks . Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it , and the sound manager does n't work for games , remember , Spectre uses it . And it works great . If Spectre can spare the CPU time , you can too . One little disclaimer : There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi ca n't be made to work right . I 'm not sure either way , but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100 % correctly on every [MASK] machine using the Sound Manager . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I need some help with a multi port [MASK] board of unknown origin . I 'm hoping someone knows what this board is , or , even better , what the various switches and jumbers are used for . Anyway , here 's description of the card : It is a 16-bit card , although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything . [MASK] has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets , and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4 . There is also an external female connector with 37 pins . There are 8 banks of 8 switches , 2 banks of 4 switches , and 7 jumpers . I believe that I have determined , by following traces , that SW5 and SW6 ( 12 switches in all ) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports . SW5 [ 1-4 ] are for IRQ3 , SW5 [ 5-8 ] are for IRQ4 , and SW6 [ 1-4 ] are for IRQ5 . The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow . The only identification printed on the board is `` MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD '' across the bottom . There is a box for serial number , but it is blank . Immediately below the words `` SERIAL NO '' , but not in the box left for the S/N , are the numbers `` 1990 2 8 '' . Anyone have any clues ? Your help is greatly appreciated . [SEP]\n",

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree ' measurement ( that the temperature is in Centigrade , rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit ) , you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions : 1 . You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually , the melting point of most iron alloys ( and steels are iron alloys ) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C. Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature , the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed , and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon . 2 .

NASA is directly descended from the NACA , with space added in . You 'll notice that I did n't mention sweep wings even though the X-5 , tested [MASK] what 's now Dryden , had them .

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling ( in the 70s and 50s , respectively ) . It 's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds ( KC-135 and YF-102 ) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement . The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us . The Air Force , of course , was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts . Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s . No mechnaical or analog backup , to show you how confident we were . General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were . ( Mind you , the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier , but analog . ) Phil > Egad ! I 'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer ! The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing . On the other hand , all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings -- something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base ca n't do . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] [ discussing the use of IRQ 7 ] To put it a little differently : - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity . - DOS does n't monitor IRQ 7 ; it uses other means to determine when it 's time to send out another byte to the printer . - Most ( all ? ) ( hardware ) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 , usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver . Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver , and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode . - Unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers ( i.e. , either assert high or assert low ) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers ( assert high , assert low , or [MASK] n't assert anything ) . The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper . ( Incidentally , note that there 's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired . If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines , and that certainly is n't a [MASK] . ) - Non-DOS operating systems ( OS/2 , NT ( ? ) , various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be ) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons .

      "[CLS] Well , there *is* a difference . I do n't happen to have my SAE manual handy , but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature . The SAE numbers are based on a ` typical ' curve that oils used to all [MASK] , running from ( say ) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C , down to ( say ) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C , for a typical 40-weight oil . Oils that are designed for operation in ` normal ' temperatures just have a weight specification . Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a ` W ' tacked on the end , so in winter in a cold place , you 'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in [MASK] in the summer , to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year . Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature . As a result , their viscosity graphs cross over several curves . A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures , a ` normal ' operating temperature and a ` cold ' one ( though I ca n't remember the numbers ... ) . In any event , the weights do indicate a significant difference . Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated ( by the thermostat and radiator or air fins ) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something . Any weight of oil is better than no oil , or than very old , carbonized oil . Thin oil wo n't ( in general ) lubricate as well at temperature , thicker oil will ( like a 20W50 ) will lubricate better at temperature , but not as well during startup , when most engine wear occurs . If you 're planning on making long drives , the 20W50 is probably fine ( esp . in the summer ) in your 10W40 car . But if you 're making short drives , stick to the 10W40 . [SEP]\n",

The article starts with `` A [MASK] of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible . '' O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research `` is a real question for me . '' O'Connor said `` everything is fair game , '' including `` dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry , chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country , working closely with the Russian space station Mir , and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned [MASK] shuttle fleet . '' O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far , and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost . The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option ( I believe Kathy Sawyer , the Post writer , got confused here . I listened in on part of O'Connor 's briefing to the press on Monday , and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options , sorted by cost [ low , medium , and high ] . In another part of the briefing , he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ SSF derivative @ LaRC , modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC , and Single Launch Core [ `` wingless Orbiter '' ] @ JSC . Later , in response to a reporters question , I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a `` moderate '' cost option , in between low & high cost options . Not the `` high cost '' option as Sawyer wrote ) . The article goes on to describe the other two options as `` one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit , similar to the Russian Mir . The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch , like Skylab . That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage , for example , in its basic structure . '' [SEP]\n",

'' A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said `` the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , '' the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported . But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment . `` This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , '' the statement reads . The five men , together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence , were captured in September 1992 [MASK] Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan , between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan , after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops . However , the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh . Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . Both [MASK] and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union , are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war . The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the Russian authorities . It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey . Itar-tass said that the soldiers ' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] The law is much worse than worthless . It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they ( the police ) find something they do n't understand . Most police do n't know what the return key does , never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets . There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either . It could be uninitialized junk . The burden of proof is on the user to show that it 's something a normal upstanding citizen should have . No one should ever be put in that situation , especially in America . What 's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it , to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer , or [MASK] bad thing is in style at the time . Basically most people do n't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects . As an analogy , it 's like they find a loose screw in your house , and they insist that you 're [MASK] a bomb or machine gun . They ask you where it came from ( like you 'd know ) , and ask you to prove your claim . When you explain it in such simple terms , people may start to get the idea . As a matter of fact , i do keep random files on my disk . The reason is , without special-purpose hardware , it takes a long time to generate good random bits . I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute , which is pretty conservative , but over time that 's more than i need . If you think about it , there 's no point in actually encrypting random data , because it just gives you different random data . If you want some data to look like an encrypted file , you just put an appropriate header on it . If enough people do this , some of them will be put in jail . When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys , you can tell them it 's just random junk , although of course they wo n't believe you . While you 're sitting in jail , you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that 's not there . [SEP]\n",

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he 's now 27 years old , I think . Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors . ( I 'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I do n't have another brain cramp and forget . ) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors . As I recall , the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit , decent fielding .

It was an article written by the leader of a national ( US ) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem . While there , he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem . The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible . What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building . The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building . Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque , making [MASK] impossible without sparking a holy war .

      "[CLS] Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems : 1 ) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM , which is what I have . This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01 . A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM . 2 ) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations : a ) Under NDW , when an entry in a list is highlighted ( such as in an Open menu ) and then is deselected , a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be . b ) With Word for Windows , when you use shading in a table , the display shows the [MASK] of the shading ; for example , if you shade the cell as 10 % , the display is 90 % ( the printout is OK ) . 3 ) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment . The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon ( or use the Debugger option in the Run command ) , and the [MASK] application goes to VGA character mode ( as it is designed to do ) . The screen goes haywire , and is largely unreadable . The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled . Through trial and error , I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [ Alt-Spacebar ] followed by the letter `` R '' . This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen , and it does this satisfactorily . I wish I did n't have to do this . The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers . The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows . There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode . The problem is not my monitor . The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one . I still like this video card , and am hoping its problems will be remedied ( they do offer a 5 year warranty ) . [SEP]\n",

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision . More than that would seem to be wasted .

When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA ( an essentially FA ) in reducing inflammation . The evidence was mixed .

I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate , and that the recorded `` impact '' actually happened . I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse , an earthquake , a temple curtain being torn , etc . The earliest written claim we have of Jesus ' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles , none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event . ( 2 ) It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was . I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen ( by disciples , or by graverobbers ) . Do n't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel , and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge . The New Testament does [MASK] that Jews believed the body had been stolen . If there were really guards , they could not have effectively made this claim , as they did . [SEP]\n",

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in this group . Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel , and Jewish identity in general , reveal biases that indicate a great steaming heap of hatred ! You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for objectivity .

So , while you claim that you do not hate anybody , there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false .

I have a local bus based card ( VL24 Bitblaster from Micron ) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards ( or at least includes drivers for them ) .

      "[CLS] All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura . Otherwise , they are following a law put into effect by the Church , and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so . Andy Byler [ You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law . The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law , and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians . This argument is based on Paul 's letters , Acts , and in a more general [MASK] , Jesus ' teachings . Further , most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday , and Paul endorsing it . I understand that these points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more time . The point I 'm making here is not that these arguments are right , but that the backing they claim is Scripture . Accepting the principle of `` sola scriptura '' does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law . Acts 15 and Paul 's letters are quite clear on that . I think even the SDA 's accept it . The disagreement is on where the [MASK] would have us place the line . By the way , Protestants do give authority to the church , in matters that are not dictated by God . That 's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies , church polity , etc . If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians , then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or ( since worship is by its nature a group activity ) churches are free to decide .

      "[CLS] ddavis @ cass.ma02.bull.com ( Dave Davis ) II . The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they are not quoted by the NT authors . That is [MASK] quite accurate . Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon ( as Dave noted ) . One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Christ . III . The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the ( uncontroverted ) parts of the canon . then I answer : These is a logically invalid *a priori* . Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test -- even though some books [MASK] as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses . For example , the Lutheran hymn `` Now Thank We All Our God '' quotes a passage from this book . The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church 's history . They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture . I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing . And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends . [SEP]\n",

I think they are correct in thinking that a well-placed bomb or six would get headlines , but I think they are wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a Buddhist . Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the Chinese occupiers . Every action is its own reward . On the other hand , people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it . And what does it cost us to admire them ? Zip . Yes they are , and whether this serves them well or not depends on whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence . And without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions ? The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists , just as the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements as terrorists . Better off in what way ? As proponents of pacifism or as proponents of political autonomy ? And better off in what time-scale ?

A `` quick look '' does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah . Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life , I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies . Let me make one point . The clash between Jeremiah and the `` false prophets '' was primarily in the theological realm . The `` false prophets '' understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David . It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant , which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David 's descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power . Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet . He was from Anathoth , across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory . When he came to prophesy , he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses . The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the [MASK] of Solomon . His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets . It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies . The `` judgement prophesies '' were deeply loaded with theological meaning .

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future , to the point of justifying development of such a thing . That 's a mighty fine idea . But since you asked `` Why not , '' I 'll respond . Putting aside the application of such a space dock , there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume . Temperature control is difficult in space , and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation ( maybe a double-walled inflatable ) . Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required . Do n't think this will be a [MASK] plastic bubble ; it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today . Because almost all manned space vessels ( Skylab , Mir , Salyut ) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity , even though they had ( have ) metal skins , they still kind of qualify as inflatable . The inflation process would [MASK] to be carefully controlled . The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials ( due to temperature extremes , monotomic Oxygen impingement , and radiation effects on materials ) , so your `` fabric '' may not retain any flexibility for long . ( This may not matter . ) Even after inflation , pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric , which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases . These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Hello there . The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought about constructing an old-time crytal radio set . I figured on substituting a modern germanium [MASK] for the crystal , and winding the antenna coil , etc. , myself . The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning capacitor -- you know , the old meshed-plate variable condensers which used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits . Well these things seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats . Trimmer capacitors [MASK] relatively abundant , but are not really suitable for this application . So , can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 0 -- 360 pF range ? Manythanks . -- [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I [MASK] a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it . I bought it in California , and if it 'll let me , I 'd like to keep it for another year . The only problem is these Indiana winters -- my heater controls do n't work . The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents . Right now it is stuck in the `` vent '' mode . It will blow warm air , but I ca n't switch the air flow to either the floor ( I can live without this ) or the defrost ( I ca n't live without this ) . I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position , but this blows a lot of air in my face and is , well , kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse . I have taken parts of the dash [MASK] and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem ( or part of it ) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow . THe diaphragm which controls outside ( vent ) /in- side ( no vent ) air is cracked most of the way around , and the other one is probably damaged too , considering the advanced age of the car . Two questions : 1 ) Is there anything I should be aware of about this ( other than the fact that I should move from Indiana ) ? 2 ) In the event that replacement diaphragms are n't available , is there a way to `` fix '' this ?

      "[CLS] I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on ( it has been a couple of years since my [MASK] Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here ... ) Basic Scenario : I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of files on disk . The general setup is designed so that when [MASK] connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public key and the user 's public-private keypair is used to wrap the one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk . The result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the machine . What is possible is for someone to use the revealed system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal private keys during the authentication sequence . Questions : Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection as far as being coerced to reveal the key ? ( I doubt it myself.. ) It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am assisting in `` entrapment '' ( the users would send thier key anyway and are not being enticed into doing something they would not otherwise do ) but is there any other hook that can be used ? Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval ? Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated ... jim [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Was going over some videos last night ... .. Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting . And enlightening . Here 's my analysis of Jose Canseco , circa Sep '92 , and Jose Canseco , circa June 1986 . 1 . He 's bulked up too much . Period . He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds , not gain more bulk . 2 . His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED . Conservatively , I 'd say he 's lost 4 % -7 % of his bat speed , and that 's a HUGE amount of speed . 3 . That open stance is KILLING him . Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing - way open to start , then closes up as ball is [MASK] . Downing could do this without significant head movement - Canseco ca n't . Also , note that Canseco does n't always close his stance the same way - sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes , they 're fully closed . Without a good starting point , it 's hard to make adjustments in your swing . What would I do , if I were Jose ? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch , so that I 'd never have to work again , I 'd restructure my entire swing . First , minimize movement before the swing . Close and widen the stance , and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing . Hopefully , this will cut down on the time I need to swing , and will allow me to move the bathead more freely . Second , drop 20 pounds . Cut out the weight work . Third , relax the wrists . Will cost some power , but until I can find my 1988 stroke , concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up , rolling the wrists through the strike zone , and hit line drives . His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park . If Canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits [MASK] a result of his back problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years . If not , he could still hit 600+ HR . [SEP]\n",

Furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast . Seriously : self discharge ( the actual problem , as stated by others ) does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self [MASK] . I have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for > 2 years so it must be possible . If your garage is heated , store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing ( flat batteries freeze more easily ) . Occasionally charge it ( once a month ? ) or even leave it on 'float ' charge permanently ( special charger , DO N'T do this unless you know what you are doing , seriously dangerous ) . Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted . Some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb . ( 6yrs , 95000 miles and counting ) [SEP]\n",

Too much can block the external auditory canal ( the hole in the outside of the ear ) and cause some hearing problems . It is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your own , or at your physician 's office . You can take a syringe ( no needles ! ) and fill it with 50 % warm water ( [MASK] can cause fainting ) and 50 % OTC hydrogen peroxide . Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up ) and insert the tip of the syringe ( helps to have someone else do this ! ) and firmly expell the solution .

You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever you may have . If wax is old , it will be harder , and darker .

It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse it out . Good Luck -heather [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I 'd use a secret ( nope , obscure ) cryptographic encoding to expand the 30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block . The redundancy hereby introduced can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy replaced the L.E . block by random data . And of course the L.E . [MASK] would be used to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E . block must be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back . For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E . block ( e.g . by xor-ing a constant pattern ) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block ( perhaps [MASK] by repeated application of the encryption algorithm or so ) at regular intervals during the transmission . If the receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and it will cease to work ; in your own interest you are protected from getting faulty plaintext , you know -- it 's just like a checksum for your own safety ; - ( . The ` monitoring agencies ' wo n't have the famous black box which is needed for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI ; but nothing prevents them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E . blocks within the transmission . These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol . So do n't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E . about the tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks than those suggested above . Of course it 's absolutely crucial that the algorithms ( and protocols ) remain secret . Personally I doubt they will . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] RE : Irish/Gaelic TrueType Font wanted - synopsis Many thanks to those who responded to my question . Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested in geting one , and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting that description . This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of Dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the early part of the century . This may take me some time to do ( in my limited spare time ) but I 'll [MASK] [MASK] available to anyone who is interested , when it is ready . The responses I received are summerised below : Kevin Donnelly ( caoimhin @ smo.ac.uk ) mentioned that Michael Everson ( everson @ irlearn.ucd.ie ) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me . I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh , and that he will eventually port them to the PC , but that he will be charging IR 100 ( about $ 160 ) for each one . pbryant @ ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them ' . These are `` Durrow '' and `` American Uncial-Normal '' . I do n't know where you can get these but I do n't think that they have the effects I am looking for . Finally , rhiannon @ netcom.com ( Rhia ) mentioned that the `` Meath '' font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing . I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply . So that 's it . I 'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available . [SEP]\n",

The original poster ( W G Wright ) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple ( a Select 300 I think ) which can print GrayScale . He then said that he CAN NOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer ( and also that all the 'experts ' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible ) . This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade ( compared to Apple 's SE to SE/30 upgrade ) : you [MASK] never be able to run Color Quickdraw . It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale . SEs CAN print some COLOUR : this is because Quickdraw - the original , non-colour version , has the right hooks for eight colours . Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph ' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE ( I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something ) . There is no reason that Apple could n't release software patches for older computers ( there are lots of Mac Pluses , Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw ) - but they wont , and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac 's ROMs ( i.e . Nutek et al. ) . Just one Caveat : I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer , that you would be able to do so , whatever Mac you were using . ( And I am [MASK] sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [ ? correct me if I 'm wrong ? ] ) . [SEP]\n",

Maybe I sound [MASK] , but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on how much David Koresh was a big , bad child abuser , and I kept wondering why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place . I 'm POSITIVE that the `` sealed warrant '' is not for child abuse . What was it for ? Peobably weapons violations . Janet Reno did n't say WORD ONE last night about weapons violations . Why ?

      "[CLS] The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image processing software that much faster .

There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the [MASK] specs by a fair margin . Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software . It works realtime , not after the fact , as is the case with Hubble .

Starting on page 52 of the April , 1993 Sky & [MASK] is a three page review of this new product . It lists for $ 1,290 . The article states : `` The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around . '' Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects , `` it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope 's focal plane . '' Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years , especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars , and many man-hours invested in its development .

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God . I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus . If anything , [MASK] clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended .

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ ( Pub . Harper and Row , 1988 ) . The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb . Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection . Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg 's work _Resurrection , Immortality , and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ ( Publ Cambridge , Havard Univ . Press , 1972 ) is most helpful . Look At Rom 1:1-3 . Paul here has no need of an empty tomb . Additionally in 1 Cor 15 , Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb . He was raised ( note the passive ) , he appeared , no ascension either . Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave . The whole idea of an empty tomb is n't broached in any of our [MASK] until well after the fall of Jerusalem . By that time , the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious . Moreover Mack has argued ( convicingly , I [MASK] ) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark ( we have no texts before this which mention the tomb ) . You are quite right here . Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable . See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_ . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it . We bought this thing because it ( 1 ) has a parallel data input in [MASK] to the usual video signal inputs and ( 2 ) claimed to print 256 gray level images . However , the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images . After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of [MASK] Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine . I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs . This was not mentioned in the sales literature . However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel ( 64 level ) images in parallel mode , but they did n't have any information about how to program it to do so , and they would call Japan , etc . Frankly , I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source , it ca n't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory . It 's not like memory is that expensive any more . If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel ( or even 8 bit/pixel ) images out of this thing , I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me . Thanks . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid . ( It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out . ) As far as I can remember , they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid : - low viscosity -- - if it 's too difficult to force the [MASK] in & out of the lungs , you ca n't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort ( let alone anything else ) - diffusion rate -- - obviously , not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out ; and the part that is n't expelled is the part that 's nearest the walls of the alveoli . ( alveolus ? ) So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid . Apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than CO2 , so even if you can get enough oxygen in , you might not be able to get enough CO2 out . - oxygen/CO2 capacity -- - you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume . Oh , and of course , your new breathing [MASK] must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that ... [SEP]\n",

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits . I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info ; int depth = 24 ; Colormap colormap ; XSetWindowAttributes attribs ; unsigned long valuemask = 0 ; Window *win ; Xv_opaque frame ; win = xv_get ( frame , XV_XID ) ; XMatchVisualInfo ( display , screen , depth , TrueColor , & visual_info ) ; /* [MASK] far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap ( display , win , visual_info , AllocNone ) ; /* It dies here with a BadMatch error : ( */ attribs.colormap = colormap ; valuemask |= CWColormap ; XChangeWindowAttributes ( display , w , valuemask , & attribs ) ; XSetWindowColormap ( display , win , colormap ) ; Am I using a completely wrong approach here ?

      "[CLS] whitsebd @ nextwork.rose-hulman.edu ( Bryan Whitsell ) sent in a list of verses which he felt condemn homosexuality . mls @ panix.com ( Michael Siemon ) wrote in response that some of these verses `` are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations '' and that others `` simply do not address the issues . '' [ remainder of my post deleted ] The moderator then made some comments I would like to address : If you are referring to the terms `` effeminate '' and `` homosexuals '' in the above passage , I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged . However , I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an `` incredibly perverse '' interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse . Therefore I do not believe it is `` incredibly perverse '' to read it in this way . Actually , I was n't thinking of the church at all . After all , a couple does n't have to be married by a minister . A secular justice of the peace could do the job , and the two people would be married . My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage , but where in the Bible would [MASK] get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex ? And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages , how willing would gay Christians be to `` save themselves '' for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship ? Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be [MASK] to be so monogamous , I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject . I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual , yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position . So what is the gay view ? - Mark [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Many pagans are involved in environmentalism -- this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations . This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it . Nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity . Like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should [MASK] , and is n't . I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten . This does n't mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . First , paganism respects the feminine . Christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many ( if not most ) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner . The idea that God is sexless , or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . This insistance on a male-dominated theology ( and the male-dominated society that goes with it ) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . Second , paganism respects the physical world . This is an idea with great ramifications . One of these is environmentalism -- respect for our surroundings and our world . Another is integration of sexuality . Christianity has a long tradition of calling [MASK] sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . This is too much -- sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) should be changed -- just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to God . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] Hello X'ers I have a problem : I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes . The following code illustrates the problem : # include < stdio.h > # include < X11/Xlib.h > # include < X11/Xutil.h > main ( ) { Display *display ; Window win ; XVisualInfo vinfo ; Colormap colormap ; XSetWindowAttributes attributes ; XEvent event ; Status status ; display=XOpenDisplay ( NULL ) ; status=XMatchVisualInfo ( display , DefaultScreen ( display ) ,24 , TrueColor , & vinfo ) ; if ( ! status ) { fprintf ( stderr , '' Visual not found\\n '' ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } colormap=XCreateColormap ( display , DefaultRootWindow ( display ) , vinfo.visual , AllocNone ) ; attributes.colormap=colormap ; win=XCreateWindow ( display , DefaultRootWindow ( display ) ,0,0,100,100 , 0,24 , InputOutput , vinfo.visual , CWColormap , & attributes ) ; XMapWindow ( display , win ) ; for ( ; ; ) { XNextEvent ( display , & event ) ; } } I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server , and with an HP 9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server ( with the obviously neccessary change ) , both running X11R4 . On the client side , I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation , and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation . All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request . As far as I can tell from the manual , the only attribute which may give a BadMatch , is the colormap , if it belongs to a wrong visual . [MASK] the visual was correctly matched , as I did not get the error message . What am I doing wrong ? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same [MASK] . Karsten -- [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years , thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians . In retrospect , I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many . I originally saw it just as poetic license , but it 's understandable that others might see it differently . I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though . I also think that your advice to Masud [MASK] : # Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee , it 's a good idea to # do a little homework , or at least think . was unnecessary . Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the [MASK] assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism . If I agreed with that , then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant . But I think you 're reading a lot into one flip sentence . While probably not true in this case , too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel .

      "[CLS] Well , yes and no . I do n't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate , but I do think it 's worth pointing out that `` popular usage '' is not always sufficient excuse . In this case , for example , I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names : if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it ? Probably not . The same is true of X . `` The X Window System '' , `` X '' , `` X11 '' , and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name . In fact , some of them are *trademarked* names . The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point . As for the trade publications that promulgate things like `` X [MASK] '' or `` X.windows '' or any of the other nonsensical [MASK] one often sees , consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists* . Would you trust the facts of a journalist who could n't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right ? Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong ? Popular usage is as it may be , but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness . [SEP]\n",

A secret algorithm can still be secure , after all , we just do n't know it . Only our level of trust is affected , not the security of the system . The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know , which we believe to be secure . They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security . They want to protect its market share . If they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow . And of course , everybody would buy them .

Quite simply , with Clipper established , it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that ca n't talk to the leading phone companies . The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 % of the populace . To get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system , and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one .

      "[CLS] My , this distinction seems quite arbitrary . Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven , whose sin is covered . ( Ps . 32:1 ) . and quoted by the apostle Paul : Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man , unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works , Saying , [MASK] are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered . Blessed is the [MASK] to whom the Lord will not impute sin . ( Rom . 4:6-8 ) The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments . The dispensational distinction is unwarranted . I 'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up . You 're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people . Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise ( cf . Ex . 18:13ff ) . It makes for interesting speculation , though . I 'll leave comments on the so-called `` bema seat '' vs. `` throne '' judgments to someone else . This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism . [SEP]\n",

      "[CLS] I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel . I would suggest that you take your code , and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed ( including to the ftp sites ) . Many folks , myself included , would enjoy the extra code . Just to clarify , the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray , not the ROM of the mac . A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics , I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot . However , it is quite limited in the sense that it 's a low-level 3D library ; your code still has to plot individual points , draw each line , etc ad nauseum .

      "[CLS] I think this is a weak argument . The fact is , there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_ , one of which has unquestionably at least [MASK] altered by Christians . Origen wrote , in the third century , that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah , while the long passage says the opposite . There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic . There is no question that Origen , in the third century , saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus . There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references . It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted , but I do n't think it 's very likely -- nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case .

There 's a [MASK] between each link where the `` teeth '' of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is a possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks `` LOOK '' a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional . Finally , I notice that when I ride with my leathers , harness boots , and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier ( BTW , I 've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock did n't pulverize any vertebrae ) , cagers give me a much wider berth , do n't hassle me , and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights .

      "[CLS] I really think you are comparing apples and oranges . Nobody disputes that OS/2 has more big OS features . The question is Does an individual need the power . The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that question . The next [MASK] is even if I did want to run OS/2 and I had this big monster machine to run it on , is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work . Go to your local computer store to answer this one . I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1 . This is where the new battle lines will be drawn . Windows 3.1 has won the single user PC war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are NT , OS2/2.1 , UNIX and Netware 4.0 . Granted these OS 's will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II ' of the war . Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure is fun watching and arguing about [MASK] tho . Thx Dave L [SEP]\n",

The Expos almost came back though ... 2 ) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980 . So close , yet , so far . and 3 ) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago . It went off the technical ring in the Big O . It almost left the stadium !

      "[CLS] Yes , absolutely , though I 'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases . But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back , once again , to equating the business of science with the end result , the gizmo produced . My point is n't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* you come about developing it . Perhaps you 'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part ( the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them , I 'm making them too ) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science . Biomedical research does n't make any basic assumptions that are n't the same as any other discipline of scientific research . That is , that you make empirical observations , form an hypothesis and test it . Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than `` the old Newtonian model of the world '' . And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical `` world view '' . Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending . Oversimplified , of course , but a good example . This is an empirical observa- tion . It was then tested , though perhaps not by Aristotle , and eventually found wanting . In the meantime , some [MASK] will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life . There 's nothing [MASK] all surprising about this , it 's the way the gathering of knowledge works . There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base , even idiotic , to someone in the future . These future people wo n't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip . Someone will have thought of something new and tested it . This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research ca n't seem to wrap their minds around . Science is a creative process . What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories . [SEP]\n",
